"Beginner's Guide to XSX/XSS, Game Pass, Storage, and More!","Welcome to the Xbox family!

The next generation of consoles is coming, as are tons of questions.

This post provides guides and resources that cover the basics of the current state of Xbox. If you're new to Xbox, read **Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass** first.

Before you proceed, please check the [FAQ tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/faq) or [Info tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/information) from [r/XboxSeriesX](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX) for more information, guides, and helpful links.

# Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass

* **Xbox Live Gold (XBL) (US $9.99 monthly):** Allows online multiplayer. Free games every month through Games with Gold. [Click here to join Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live)
* **EA Play (US $4.99 monthly):** Library of older games published by EA. New games are added 6-9 months after release.
* **Game Pass for PC/Game Pass for Console) (US $9.99 monthly):** Game subscription service providing access to over 200 Microsoft and third-party games. First-party MS games stay forever while third-party titles are timed. Includes EA Play as of Holiday 2020.
* **xCloud** \- Cloud game streaming service for mobile access to select Game Pass titles. Still in Beta and not available as a standalone product.
* **Game Pass Ultimate (GPU) (US $14.99 monthly):** Includes Xbox Live Gold, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, Game Pass for Console, and xCloud in one package.

## Game Pass Ultimate And XBL Conversion For $1

Microsoft currently allows you to convert Xbox Live Gold time and Game Pass for PC or Console time to Game Pass Ultimate time at a 1:1 ratio for either $1 or $14.99, based on your eligibility and up to a maximum of 36 months (three years). The estimated savings for the full three years if you buy XBL at retail price is at least US $359* (corrected).

A loophole in this policy allows you to buy up to three years of XBL, redeem it to your Microsoft account, and convert it to GPU. While you don't have to get three years, you save the most money this way.

* When will this promotion end? **No date confirmed**
* Can I do this if I have before? **Yes**
* Can I do this if I currently have a GPU subscription active? **No, adding XBL to your account converts at a 3/1 ratio**
* Can I do this if I currently have a Game Pass for PC or Console subscription active? **Yes**
* Can I do this without an Xbox? **Yes**
* Can I buy XBL from a different region where it's cheaper? **Yes, but you must use a VPN and you may experience region issues with the code redemptions**
* Can I do this if I am no longer eligible for the $1 promotion price? **Yes, but you must make a one-time US $14.99 payment instead of $1**

**Note:** If the total time (XBL + Game Pass time) in your account is more than 36 months, use a PC to activate the promotion. Any time over the 36 month maximum will **disappear**.

### Instructions

1. On your [Microsoft Account](https://account.microsoft.com/services), turn off any existing recurring billing for Game Pass or XBL.
2. Purchase three 12-month Xbox Live Gold cards for your region from a retailer like Amazon, Microsoft, Costco, CDKeys, or others. **Note:** CDKeys is a ""gray market"" site that sells these cards at steep discounts. They're easy to use and reliable.
3. Visit [redeem.microsoft.com](https://redeem.microsoft.com/) and redeem each XBL key. For each key, turn off the recurring billing toggle before you click **Submit**.
4. Check that you have at least 36 months of time on your account (XBL time + Game Pass time).
5. Visit the [Xbox Game Pass page](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) for your region and click **Join Now**.
6. Click **Join for $1** under *Ultimate*.
7. Follow the prompts and provide your payment information when asked.

You should see that all your Game Pass and XBL time now says *upgraded to Game Pass Ultimate* in your Microsoft account.

# Backwards Compatibility

The new Xbox consoles support all Xbox One titles as well as any Xbox/Xbox 360 titles that are already supported on Xbox One.  
You may experience improvements to load times, framerate, and resolution.

Kinect and headsets with optical sound connectors are not currently supported.

# Expanding Storage

The new Xbox consoles have a storage expansion slot. Currently the only supported storage for this slot is the [Seagate Expansion Card](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-1tb-expansion-card). You can install games here and play them directly from the card.

While pricey, cheaper third-party alternatives are inevitable down the road.

You can also use an external USB HDD or SSD to store Series X or S games that you aren't playing. You can't play these directly from the drives and need to transfer them back to supported storage.

You can use an external drive to play non-enhanced backwards-compatible games from the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox.

For a quick reference, see [this diagram](https://i.imgur.com/AwGKbwu.jpg) (courtesy [u/beateride](https://www.reddit.com/u/beateride)) and [Xbox Expansion Explained](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/24/xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s-custom-storage-solution-primer/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) for more detailed information.

# Xbox All Access

[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access)

Xbox All Access is a monthly payment option which gives you a console and two years of GPU. The Xbox Series S is $24.99 a month and the Xbox Series X is $34.99, in the U.S.

All Access involves opening a line of credit with a local credit issuer through the Microsoft-authorized service provider in your area. This means a credit check that usually impacts your credit score.

To see if All Access is available in your region, see the [supported regions list](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/09/xbox-all-access-expands-to-12-countries-this-holiday/).

# Bethesda Acquistion

There is no confirmation on if Xbox will make Bethesda games exclusive. Phil Spencer said it will be on a ""case-by-case basis"" for console exclusivity.

All Bethesda games are set to be added and launched on Game Pass.

Microsoft can’t make exclusive games! Xbox sucks! Nooo!” At least, that’s what I get reading between the lines of all the social media posts asking if future Bethesda games will be Xbox exclusive.

They then had super hyped in house games which had a good Fable tease but had a showing of Halo so bad that To has to delayed the game. 

While Sony was killing it with their reveals. 


That in contrast with the Series S reveal leaked at like 3:00 Am with only a meme to confirm it. Generating massive buzz and final a price.

Time to knock sense into people. Zenimax property like Bethesda will be only on Xbox ecosystem. It's not rocket and science. It's business.,"I saw many conversation about many fans who concerned about whether they can play MS PROPERTY games on others platform. The answer is **YES** and **NO**. You can play their game on any platform- **PC/Xbox or Mobile** but it's only in **THEIR Ecosystem** aka MS/Xbox ecosystem. 

The facts of matter is:
- It's not ""exclusive"" or anti consumer/ It's BUSINESS. Take a look at your restaurant, take a look at your house, take a look at Coca and Pepsi or Netflix. No Restaurant or anybody SHARE their secret sauces. If MC Donald, Coca produce their ingrident for their softdrink. Why would they share their invention to others? 

You see the point here? **Xbox want people to drag into their ecosystem**. The **same** way that ALL others company in the world is doing. They own property, they won't share it to others. **What in the world you are living to believe Intel will Produce chip for AMD? Or Netflix content will be on Disney plus** 

Anothers major facts: Console market is less than 10%. PC is 48% and the rest is mobile.  So ""losing"" PS market is NONSENSE. PS fan will be attracted to MS ecosystem if they want to play MS property.  MS are too big like Netflix that they don't care much about console sales, their majority focus right is now is on Cloud. Which mean mostly PC+Mobile which are over 70% of market share.   The ""lost"" in PS or nintendo is NOTHING, compare to what they gain. Fame, Playerbase and Money",XboxSeriesX,25,0.67
Just got a preorder in,"I noticed the other day that I still had a Series X in my cart at Microsoft’s site. I had already placed my order by the way but would love to secure one for a friend. I clicked the Place Order button and got an error message that order cannot be placed. 

After seeing someone on here mention an auto clicker I set one up to click Place Order every 10 seconds. Well it’s been a few hours and low and behold I just got a confirmation order that my order has been placed. 

If anyone has one stuck in their cart use an auto clicker and set it and forget it.",XboxSeriesX,41,0.82
Does anyone else's pre-order from Wal-Mart.com say that it'll be arriving on the 12th instead of the 10th?,"It's not that important but I was just curious. Maybe they don't do release day delivery? I didn't see any ""pay for expedited shipping"" option when I checked out but then again I could've just missed it.",XboxSeriesX,35,0.91
I think I may have found a way to make this month fly by,"I've been seeing a lot of post of people that are so eager to get their XBox Series x,,  unfortunately I'm one of them  so I was thinking of a way to make this month fly by,  I may have found the perfect solution.  I was digging through my stuff and found my old Xbox One X Box,  inside I  still had the unused code for the free month Game Pass membership.

Are JRPG (and jap. games in general) fans just a vocal minority?,"We had many exclusive shmups and JRPG on the 360 and nothing on the One. Now the standard narrative is ""They don't sell on Xbox"" but is that really the case?

Nier Automata did really good and BandaiNamco and SquareEnix release all the big titles, Kemco ports all the mobile SNES-style JRPG and we finally got Yakuza, Kingdom Hearts and will get Dragon Quest 11.

Are fans of japanese games just a vocal minority? Every comment section of a new trailer, game reveal or news article is filled with comments of fans who want those games. Genshin Impact releases tomorrow on EVERY platform - except Xbox. Same with Ryza 2 later this year. Wonderful101 remake was announced for Xbox and removed later during the Kickstarter.

Atlus was surprised how good Persona sold on Steam and they want to port more. They still skip Xbox even though Sega sees how well their games do on Gamepass. I'm fine with digital only releases because the print runs are apparently way too big for those niche titles.

Would you buy and play japanese games or do you think Switch/PS4 and apparently now also Steam is the best place for them?",XboxSeriesX,61,0.82
My wife won the series x from Taco Bell and I dont know what to do.,"I have not owned a Xbox since my 360 Elite  I jumped over to Playstation and never went back....until now.  I really didn't think I would be joining the Xbox community anytime soon.  Afterall I already have my ps5 pre-ordered. 

When she said she won it I was surprised cause I didn't believe people actually win these things. I'm still unsure if we are going to keep it or sell it to someone at work for cheap.  Our son has been asking for an xbox since all his cousins have one.  I know they won't be getting the series x anytime soon though.  I would assume he could still play games online with them?

I've been watching things on this sub for a bit but don't know much other than specs and the games that are coming out. Any advice would be great or maybe just what you are most excited about for the xsx.  Any advice would be most welcome.  Thanks.",XboxSeriesX,9,0.75
Forbes contributor for games changes opinion and now thinks Microsoft will keep future games exclusive,"Seems like a lot of people were thinking, and Playstation fans were hoping, that Microsoft would continue to publish Bethesda games for Playstation.

Gamesharing Question with the Xbox One X and Xbox Series X,"My friend and I Gameshare and look forward to continuing to Gameshare but I have a few questions with the new Xbox Series X and Xbox One X.

My friend has the Xbox One X and his account is the primary account. I will be getting the Xbox Series X come November. I know Gameshare will still be a viable option however, does it matter since his account is the primary account and he will still be on the Xbox One X? Also, If the primary account is on the Xbox One X will the Xbox Series X games, we share still provide me with Smart Delivery of an updated version to the Xbox Series X graphics?",XboxSeriesX,4,0.99
Some notes on why the Bethesda acquisition happened and what it means for TES/FO and Xbox going forward,"ZeniMax/Bethesda were struggling financially a lot before Microsoft acquired them, that's why the owners were trying to sell the company. It's why Bethesda made Elder Scrolls Online and FO76, why they leaned so hard into microtransactions, and they still weren't financially stable. They needed to be acquired to keep the company's finances solvent and be able to continue making games, Microsoft had the money to support them to continue making great games. Be glad that Microsoft bought it, because the bidder they won against was fucking EA, and EA would have absolutely gutted Bethesda Game Studios and everything else under ZeniMax.

Read more about Bethesda's fragility and the potential for an EA acquisition here if you're interested: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/from-banking-scandal-to-video-game-ceo-to-billion-dollar-score

And more about the volatile nature of the industry leading to Bethesda's troubles here: https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/22/xboxs-bethesda-acquisition-is-evidence-of-blockbuster-gamings-volatility/amp/?__twitter_impression=true


Here's an examination of how games acquisitions have gone in the past, noting that EA is five of these examples and they have consistently completely fucked over acquisitions, so it's fantastic that they didn't get Bethesda/ZeniMax: https://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-12-of-gamings-biggest-studios-after-they-were-sold/

And if you're worried because of the two terrible Microsoft examples in that documentary (Ensemble and Lionhead), here's a fantastic documentary on the development of Halo Wars that tells the full story of why Ensemble shut and it's a lot more complicated than just ""Microsoft closed Ensemble"": https://youtu.be/igaB219Ic8c

As for Lionhead, what ruined them was the Kinect bullshit Microsoft was pulling at the start of the Xbox One generation, with Don Mattrick forcing them into making Kinect games. Absolutely, insanely, terrible decision making. Out of touch with Xbox employees and customers and leading to the worst generation launch of Xbox ever. Microsoft removed Don Mattrick and replaced him with Phil Spencer, who ended the Kinect bullshit and has dramatically improved Xbox. Don Mattrick literally did not care about Xbox (https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1102441475898404864?s=19) and Phil Spencer understands exactly what went wrong with the launch and is committed to not repeating those mistakes (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/). I also find it interesting that if you go back and rewatch that terrible launch, the first time anyone talks about games is 30 minutes in when Phil Spencer shows up to introduce some EA game.

I get why people are worried, and I don't like the industry consolidating or the practice of exclusives either. But Bethesda Game Studios are by far my favourite studios, they were going under without a buyer, and Microsoft outbid EA. EA would have unceremoniously killed TES and Fallout by taking all of the recent Bethesda microtransaction/games as a service shit and turning it up to 11 for every game. At least as Microsoft exclusives, they can make high quality single player games, and the only requirement on the games is that they be desirable enough to drive console sales, aka the games just need to be good, not super profitable, much like God of War.",XboxSeriesX,93,0.94
Let's talk about the other studios a part of the Bethesda deal,"If you are an Xbox fan is been a rollercoaster high week with the acquisition of Bethesda/Zenimax. It has been at this point discussed extensively what the acquisition means debated whether the games will go to other consoles and what the big studios will offer. For Bethesda Softworks, ID Software, Zenimax Online, and to some extent Machine Games and Arkane. We know the IP's: Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Starfield, Doom, Wolfenstein, Dishonored, Evil Within, Quake, and Ghost Wire. 

We know that Arkane is doing Deathloop and working on new IP your guess is as good as mine as to what that is whether they continue Dishonored or do something else. Machine Games could work on new IP after putting out 3 or 4 Wolfenstein games or continue with spin-offs. Tango is locked on Ghostwire and Evil Within. The interesting conversation is Alpha Dog and Roundhouse.

Both are studios that are actually under Bethesda and not independent studios under Zenimax. One is a studio concentrated on mobile games and the other is Human Head re-branded. These are more like support AA studios. There are 3 options for the direction of these studios they stay the same, they stay the same and become support studios, or they grow and shift direction and become studios that do new IP or work on existing Bethesda IP in new ways or Microsoft IP.

   So what am I getting at you have Blades and Fallout Shelter plus current games that are on mobile for Alpha Dog to help Bethesda with and their games. Those are games with tens or hundreds of million players that can go to X Cloud as Shelter is already on Xbox and we may see a new version of that. There is also a huge opportunity for these studios to expand and certain IP that can our huge opportunities to continue on Xbox and now have the manpower and dev assets to plan that out. I am talking of Mech Assault as part of the Battletech Series and Killer Instinct. Mech Assault could be a great direction for Machine Games if they take a break from Wolfenstein but you can get several studios working on a project like that and provide a mech game with an awesome engine and shooting mechanics and invest in the lore and be narrative-driven. Killer Instinct with Roundhouse or help remasters or remake Ryse Son of Rome with Crytek. This is speculation and what I might like to see that can be done. What are yours? What do you think should or will be done with these lesser-known studios or even possibly studios at a crossroads and not as monetarily successful as Bethesda and ID but that can be invested in and have massive potentials like Arkane, Tango, and Machine. What dream games would you like to see them tackle with Bethesda acquisition?",XboxSeriesX,17,0.79

Settup Up Multiple Xbox in the House,"I currently have an Xbox One S and I'm planning to get an Xbox Series X.  I am signed into the S under my own account and my kid has played games under it for a long time.  So, my account is pretty much mixed up with my own friends and his friends.  I want him to have his own account so that we can seperate that.  Some questions though.

1. I'm guessing he'd have to re add all his friends and I can boot them off mine.  How would it work for games like Fortnite?  How can I transfer all that to his account?
2. To continue using the One S, I guess I set the X to Home(?) and S as an additional one?
3. Would I set up both of our accounts on each Xbox and then we can just sign in as needed?
4. How would game sharing work?  Xbox gold pass?  Would I be able to share my purchases with him?  And vice versa?

I think Ninja theory could do some crazy stuff with the DOOM IP. Obviously don’t call it DOOM and don’t make it an FPS. 

Double Fine: Viva Piñata or Banjo

Basically the same thing they did for Forza but for flight sim. Give us an arcade open world version of MS flight sim with the “sim” portion toned way down and more fun shit to do. 

The Coalition: Trenched

Hopefully MS acquisition of Bethesda will be a chance to produce quality RPGs that are more similar to old titles than recent ones.,"I really hope that the acquisition brings new ideas and creativity to the RPG division because I always felt that the quality of the games got worse and worse with each title. 
Beside the micro transaction stuff, I always felt that they kept dumbing down their game to cater to larger audiences. Now with gamepass that problem is over so I really wish they looked at the past rather than the recent games.

Morrowind is by far better than Oblivion, which in turn is better than Skyrim. Of course Skyrim has the prettier graphics, but nothing can beat the sense of immersion and customization that I had with Morrowind. 

Obviously we don’t even have to talk about Falliut 76.., but I always felt that Fallout 3 experience was superior to Fallout 4.

The next Xbox Games Showcase,"This has in my opinion been the overall greatest month in Xbox history. The Series S reveal, price and release reveal, preorders selling out in multiple countries, the success of XCloud, Bethesda acquisition, and now sending units to media outlets for gameplay. 

Xbox has a lot of good momentum right now, and they need to keep their foot on the gas pedal until launch. October would be great month for another games showcase. 

Matt Booty said that we haven’t heard from all studios. From the July Showcase we’ve haven’t seen what’s going on with The Coalition, Mojang, Worlds Edge, InExile, Compulsion, and The Initiative. Plus the newly acquired Bethesda studios. 

I also see this as an opportunity to provide insight on the games from studios we’ve not seen, updates on previously announced titles, as well as GamePass promotions. 

Hypothetically speaking I could see The Initiatives Game be the opener. It’s in a playable state, at this point i feel we should at least get a reveal trailer. 

And then towards the end they pass it to their Bethesda Studios. Todd Howard shows Wolfenstein 3, ESO expansion, Doom DLC, shadow drops all Bethesda titles on GP, and then they “and one more thing” and it is Starfield with an April 2021 release date. A man can dream right?",XboxSeriesX,16,0.89

Are bought expansions/DLC unplayable when a game leaves Game Pass?,"The title says it all. What happens when you have bought DLC or a expansion of a Game Pass game and the base game leaves Game Pass? Are you stranded with unplayable DLC? That is kinda weird.

If true I also think it's the opposite of what Game Pass really achieves. Worries free I can hop into all these different first and third party games. I know most third party games leave Game Pass eventually. This don't worries me because If I played the game and I liked it I just buy the game. But it does worry me when I want to buy a cosmetic item (DLC) or a Story DLC and I know there is a chance I will ""lose"" the option to enjoy this content if I don't spend money on buying the game when its leaving Game Pass.

Xbox has done a complete 180 since the whole Halo Infinite fiasco.,"When the gameplay event happened back in July, Xbox didn’t seem like it was in the best place and I think we can all agree with that.

Announcement after announcement. Reveal after reveal. Amazing PR lately. They released MFS, announced game streaming was going public with GPU, announced the very affordable Series S, Xbox all access, game pass additions, Game Pass X EA Play, and who could forget, the purchase of Bethesda!

I’m sure I’m forgetting some other stuff too but they have really made a complete turn around from where they were 2-3 months ago. And they’ve been killing it on social media lately too.

XSX or upgrading my PC,"So I currently have a ryzen 2600 with rx 580. I am in a weird spot regarding what path to take. Please discuss

Points favouring upgrading PC:
1.Planning upgrade to a 3060 or AMD equivalent means i will probably have a better GPU than XSX.
2. I already have majority of friends that play on PC not on consoles
3. I already have atleast 150usd worth of games on PC which means i have a small library that I can't bring with me to XSX

Points against upgrading
1. I might only be able to afford a 1080p 144hz monitor which I do not want. 
2. I will have to change my PSU aswell (It's a MasterWatt Lite don't laugh 😭) which adds further cost.
3. I would prefer a 4k TV like TCL P8 because I could watch Netflix and other 4k content on it while being able to play XSX
4. XSX is more portable than lugging around a cpu case
5. Now the most important point. I am entering the phase of my life where I do not think I will have enough time to do upgrades and the usual PC troubleshooting (Even though I am tech savvy enough to do it) I will be an actual registered doctor in 3 months and the 32 hour shifts that come with it are no joke. I would want just a plug and play device which doesn't give me a hassle after a long day at work. I will also ofcourse keep XSX for a few years and might get married and have children in the next 3-4 years which might mean even less time for upgrading and troubleshooting.

Do i have to buy it on the Xbox One store, and then it would appear on my Series X install page? Or can i buy the same version of the game on the Series X store, and just directly install it there.

I only ask, because I don't want to, say, buy it on the Xbox One, and it only be playable on the Xbox One. Or similarly, I don't want to go to buy it on the Series X, and it by the Series X version that doesn't release for another year or two.

Was reading the Taco Bell Xbox Series X FAQ section and there's a reference to EA's comment (Reddit's most downvoted comment).,,XboxSeriesX,23,0.96
The difference between this launch and previous ones,"Do you remember the xbox one launch?  Aside from the kinnect only games, there weren't that many that could not be played on the xbox 360.  Forza, assassins creed Black flag, call of doodie ghosts, lego marvel superheroes.  I think, of all of these games, the only ones that were next gen only were dead rising 3 and ryse, and I wonder if these games **really** couldnt have played on the xbox 360 too.

This gen there is alot of focus on **true** next gen titles.  With Xbox setting the way and saying everything will be playable on XB1 the initial reaction was ""XB1 will hold games back"" but, now that Sony have decided to cash in too, this is no longer a problem.  Curious huh!  But anyways, I digress.

I've been looking at the titles and this time the only next gen title is the medium, which is fine.  But I wonder why it is such an issue for so many people.

In reality every game over the next couple of years will have had some sort of development on the XB1 (Or in GTAVs case, the XB 360).  Which means the majority of games could have worked on the XB1.  So why shouldn't they?

I appreciate some people want that next generation feel but here I am thinking all of these games will look better on the next gen consoles and, if you haven't played a game, what's the problem with a next gen update?  They could just have held off the release of these games and pegged them as a ""next gen only"" launch titles, but what is the point if it *could* be made to play on multiple generations?

Then I look at titles like gears 5 ultimate, being updated for next gen.  Ironic that if it were not released last year, and the back compat was removed, people wouldn't be questioning if it were next gen or not.  Personally...I haven't played a load of the games that are being ""enhanced"" for next gen yet due to time, and I cant imagine I'm the only one.  So does that make them ""next gen""?

I guess I'm just poking at the thought that, it doesnt really matter where a game was released first (bright memory for example).  If the game is good then we have plenty to be excited about.

Placing the SX on top of a subwoofer?,"My setup is a bit limited.

I have other places I can put the SX, but I was wondering if placing it on top of a subwoofer is ok? I am worried that the bass from the woofer might somehow slowly wiggle something loose in the console.

Slipspace Engine rumored 500 million development cost makes sense with Zenimax acquisition,"The rumor that halo infinite development so far cost 500 million and that most time was spent on the slipspace engine may actually make sense with this acquisition. If MS planned to acquire Zenimax for years, developing a new engine for titles that long have used out dated engines such as Fallout, would totally make sense, it enables those future zenimax games that need a new engine to immediately have one available to them, and not need 3-5 years for engine development plus 3-5 years for game development. Could a future fallout game, or Elder scrolls, be built on the slipspace engine?

Now is the time for Xbox to hit hard and go full steam. Amazon Luna is on paper a huge threat,"Amazon Luna has huge international coverage. The Twitch integration is an advantage.

Their Ubisoft deal is a plus too. They call it Ubisoft channel with their new games available on day one. This implies that their will be other channels. 

Speculation: What if PlayStation makes a deal with Amazon? PSnow is already a streaming service, combined with Amazon Luna offer, it can become a stiff competitor to xCloud. 

Amazon Luna has just been announced. We still haven't seen it in action yet. Therefore, if Xbox keeps building on its momentum, keeps pushing games out and if, this is something their are lacking doing, they start to do more TV commercials and all sorts of adverts, then a comfortable advance can be built.

I am quite confident that when DF will post their Xbox Series X video, it will boost the sales even further up. 

I don't know if this post will be pushed away as being uninteresting, or too speculative. 

If not:

Do you foresee an Amazon Playstion deal?

"One account, multiple consoles","Hey,

If I own a Series S and a Series X, am I able to log into both with one account?

I searched around online and found info about game sharing etc (for people who have kids and share games to their account/machine).  But I don't want to do that, just me, one account at the same address so the same wifi network/ip etc. I'm not account sharing or anything weird.

Just trying to figure out if I can, say log into my series S in the bedroom and access everything I own from there. (or at least things the S can access, such as the digital games i own).

I assume though, if say someone was watching Netflix downstairs the system would log them out if I logged into the series S upstairs.  Not a big issue as I doubt i'd ever need both consoles logged in at the same time anyway, but just struggled to find much info for people who want multiple machines but not for sharing games with other users/accounts.

Think i've just been spoiled by Netflix in that I can watch part of an episode on my PC and then continue watching from where I left off on my TV etc.  I just really like that freedom, so it would be nice for my console to do the same.

Again, not a huge issue. But I was just curious but struggled to find info that wasn't all about  parents/kids to share games.  I just want to be able to log into whatever console I want and access my full account.

I'm pretty sure i will be able to but just wasn't quite sure what dodgy restrictions they might have in place.  Nintendo, for example, are massively annoying in that consoles are tied to accounts for the most part.

Because of the Bethesda deal, I think far more devs will remember how fat Microsoft's wallet is and think twice before signing some exclusivity deal with sony. Last time I checked, Microsoft had $133B sitting in cash, not net worth, but cash. And with gamepass, the series s, and now the bethesda acquisition, I can definitely see xbox selling more in the US than playstation, giving devs another reason to work with xbox.",XboxSeriesX,17,0.79

Is the current Game Pass Ultimate price point sustainable?,"Long time PlayStation fan here considering picking up an Xbox Series X with Game Pass Ultimate.

The one thing that scares me about Game Pass is whether the $15/month price point for GPU will stay at $15 for the foreseeable future, or will it slowly creep up?

I work in pricing and have had experience with SaaS pricing before. Usually subscription prices start at an unsustainable level and slowly creep up over time, yet the churn rate isn’t as bad since people slowly get walled into the ecosystem by then.

Do you guys think GPU price point will increase over the next few years? $15/month sounds very appealing to me right now, yet I can’t help but wonder what happens in 2-3+ years to the pricing.",XboxSeriesX,30,0.7

I've tried my best so far, but I still don't 100% get, what is in Game Pass Ultimate and EA Play.

Do we know wether Xcloud will support gyro aiming?,"So one of the big reasons why I planned on getting a PS5 before getting an Xbox is that the Dualsense has a motion sensor that allows for gyro aiming in shooters.

It's something I've grown very accustomed to when playing on Nintendo Switch and at this point I don't think I can go back to standard stick aiming and having to rely on aim assist.

But now it seems like a lot of shooters like Doom, Wolfenstein and Prey are becoming Xbox first party titles. Unfortunately even the new Xbox controller still seems to not have any motion sensors. But I just remembered that you will be able to play Xbox games on your phone via Xcloud. Gyro aiming is also quite popular on phones and frankly I have no idea how you would even play a shooter on your phone without gyro.

So does that mean that you can use a controller that supports gyro and use it to play Xbox games via xcloud on your phone?

Could you possibly connect that controller to your Xbox and get the same gyro functionality when playing directly on your console?",XboxSeriesX,4,0.4

Xbox Series X/S Post Pre-order Megathread,"Hey r/XboxSeriesX

It's been a crazy 48 hours since the Xbox Series X and S went on sale. Many victorious stories of people spamming the F5 key fast enough to get through and unfortunately sad stories of others being beaten by the dreaded web page error demon. Whichever way you look at it, emotions were all over the place.

We have been noticing a lot of posts coming up of people celebrating their pre-orders, noticing their pre-orders being cancelled, and others noticing some sites still having stock and wanting to share. So we figured it would be best to have a megathread for everyone to share all this information in one place. So any of these posts made outside of the megathread will be removed, it all must be put in here.

We would love to try and update this posts with links to sites, but with how quick they sell out we just wouldn't be fast enough so we'll be keeping the sorting by new as the default so people will hopefully be able to catch those type of posts. For those having their pre-orders cancelled, be sure to share it here and any solutions that you might have to help others so that they don't fall victim to it too if its possible to avoid happening. If the solutions are verified to work, I will update this megathread showing the solutions.

Who Here Is Getting The Series X A Year Or Six Months Later From Launch?,"IMO, I feel that the Series X is a console with great value and the recent MS acquisition of Bethesda has made me desire the Series X a lot more. However, I won't be getting it at launch and instead around the holidays next year. I feel that the main big reason is that the Series X is seeming like a console that will start to gain value later on in the console generation. Although upcoming games like Avowed, Hellblade 2, and the Bethesda acquisition (with the prospect of future Bethesda titles like Starfield and Fallout 5 being exclusive) has made me want the Series X, most of these games are probably coming out Q4 2021 at the earliest and the effects of the Bethesda acquisition will probably not be so relevant in the first two years of the generation. Because of this, the Series X **at launch** does not seem very appealing, but I think that it will possibly become the best value console when the main Xbox exclusives really start showing up midway in the generation. Although Gamepass undoubtedly has great value, it isn't appealing to me since I'm the sort of person who likes having games physically and also since I already own most games on Gamepass that appeal to me now. As of now, the Series X launch lineup looks less appealing than the PS5 one which has games that appeal to me like Spider-man and Demon's Souls (so I'll be getting the PS5 first since it offers better value to me now), but the Series X (with all the new studios and IP's Xbox has acquired, plus Phil Spencer at the helm) seems to be shaping up as the sleeping giant of the next-gen console generation thats poised to bring the best value and most likely some of the best games. I would like to know your thoughts and opinions on this (and if anyone is of similar opinion), and I'm excited to join you all on Xbox later next year.",XboxSeriesX,31,0.41

"Are there any versions of games that will only have the xb1 version? As in, no smart delivery?","After talking with my wife, we have decided that the XB approach to cross-gen games seems better in the sense there is only 1 disc to buy for the xb1's and the series. So we are going to use our XBSX for all the cross gen stuff, and the ps5 for the sony exclusives and online stuff.

My question is, are they ALL like this for now? Or are some going to be just xb1 versions and others will be only for series games? 

I ask because I'm looking into preordering AC Valhalla as something to play on the XB when it launches. Most places like gamestop, bby, target, etc, all seem to show a cover with the smart delivery logo on them, and say Xbox 1 / Xbox Series, leading me to think I could just get that 1 disk, and it would play at varying levels depending on if it was in the xb1, xb1x, or the series x.  However, walmart appears to be selling it for $10 less than the others, but the picture for that one looks like it is ONLY an xbox one game? So would that version not have any series x enhancement? Or is it just a situation where they have the wrong picture, and that's the same game everyone else is selling?

XSX with PC,"Will games optimized for XSX run better than a “high end” PC?

Towards the end of last generation, with the release of Destiny 2 on PC, I decided to build my own rig, 1080ti 8700k, runs games great with high frame rates (120 FPS at 1440p) and a high FOV.

I have been an Xbox gamer since the dawn of halo, but now I am questioning this upcoming generation. I have an X1X in home and have a XSX preordered currently.

Everyone says I don’t need an Xbox because everything I can get on PC. Problem is, Gamepass ultimate divides games between PC and console (like Doom Eternal coming up or how Red Dead Redemption 2 was only on Xbox Gamepass). They also enhance certain games for the X1X and will do so for XSX.

So should I keep the XSX preorder and sell my X1X? Sell both? Just want another perspective on maximizing value here going forward.

PSA - You can get up to 3 years of gamepass ultimate for cheap,"With the new Series S/X coming out I'm not sure how many people already have game pass and I figured I'd share this little tip. But to start off this wont work if you already have gamepass ultimate and its only a $1 upgrade if you haven't already used the $1 trial.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently with Microsoft you can upgrade xbox live gold (up to 36 months) to gamepass ultimate for as little as $1. To do this you have to purchase 12 month xbox live gold cards from a retailer, I used Costco as it was $10/card cheaper. Once you have them add them to your account, once all your xbox live gold cards are added visit [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join) and sign up for the 1$ ultimate trial and your done! This automatically converts all your xbox live gold time into gamepass ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to note is as you are adding the xbox live gold cards to your account it will offer you free trials or bonus's for subscribing and such, decline them all. If you are already subscribed to gamepass ultimate instead of a 1:1 transfer, you will only get 1 month of ultimate for every 4 months from an xbox live gold card (so 12 months of gold only gives you 4 months of ultimate). However if your xbox ultimate subscription is a month to month you can simply cancel it and this will still work like normal ;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: just to add this still works even if you've already used the gamepass $1 promo, as long as you dont have an active gamepass sub you can upgrade xbox live gold 1:1 but you will be charged for 1 month of gamepass instead of $1 (for me that was $16 cad).

Phil Spencer - the best thing to happen to Xbox since Halo,"Just a few weeks ago, people were calling for his job. Phil Spencer has shifted focus not only for Xbox, but Microsoft, and has put in place a plan for the next 5-8 years. 

When he took over for the disgraced Don Mattrick, Xbox was in shambles. They knew they had to get rid of Kinect, and in the process take away their whole plan for the past years. They took the in-game tumor that was Kinect and erased it. They worked on things like Xbox back compatibility and made it a reality. They didn't completely buy in the doomed VR phases of the game industry. They shied away from spending money on ""exclusive content"" as that would bring more trouble.

What they did do is acquire and put some love into several more studios, create the best value in gaming in Game Pass, and create good will with their consumer base who just wanted great games on a great ecosystem/platform. The future is bright because of Phil, and while he did axe projects because they were dead in the water he also made Crackdown 3 happen, which is a game I really enjoyed almost as much as the first. He also has put money and his own stature at Microsoft on the bet of a better Xbox. The one many of us are trying to preorder with no luck.

SpaceX Confirms Below 40ms Starlink Latency,"Starlink is currently in beta tests in the US and expanding it's array by 120 satellites a month. In two years it's 3000+ (and growing monthly) satellites will be providing cheap low latency high speed internet across the world while driving intense competition among all internet providers.

Microsoft is positioning the Xbox ecosystem in myriad ways to take fullest advantage of the emerging low cost high speed worldwide internet availability.

The goal of Microsoft is to have 1 billion+ gamers on a gaming subscription. Which is looking ever more doable. Also why they keep adding to their studio and gaming IP stable.

Meanwhile Sony is tightly focused on turning the PS5 into a profit making venture to the detriment of it's gaming base in other areas (restricted BC, not growing PS Now - basically eliminating as much as possible anything within it's own ecosystem which would distract PS5 owners from buying those $70 PS5 games).

How can we transfer all our games to both consoles for free or will only one console get all the games? (Extra info: we play on 2 different accounts and my account is the home Xbox)

2. I have a 2tb WD_ BLACK P10 external hard drive for my Xbox 1. So if I plug this into an Xbox Series X I will have 3tb total storage but only the 1tb on the console will be able to run next gen games?

Series X pre ordered. Keeping One X as secondary gaming console vs xCloud on phone.,"Already posted a similar post on here but would wanna gather more thoughts on this. So I was a PlayStation guy pretty much all generation. Got a One X in April in case I couldn't get a Series X and to make the move to Xbox already. Loved it and my PS4 Pro went unused for months. I always had the idea of selling my One X for the Series X but now I'm attached to it cuz it's amazing and it could still be handy for a few years. I'd use it on my 1080p tv in my bedroom and the Series X in the living room on the 4K.

The thing tempting me to trade it is that I'd pay around $30 for my Series X. I have a second kid due in April and I'd wanna save as much as I could for that. Without trading the One X, I'd pay $240 ish out of pocket for the console, controller, warranty and battery pack since I'm trading more things. So it could obviously save me money so kinda obvious what I should do.

BUT I wanna keep it for occasions I wanna be in the room when company is over. I could free up the living room and they could chill there instead of being in the kitchen all the time and I could be in the room left alone. Also like I said with a second kid on the way, I could use the One X for occasions I can't come to the living room and have to be in the room to help out. Baby can fall asleep and I'll play quietly for a bit. Also I would like to be in bed with my girls on lazy days and play.

The thing making me double think a console in the room is that I know when I can play, I'll wanna play on the big 4K. I've had consoles in the room before and I don't use them that much.

So with that being said, would I just be better off using an Xbox One controller and using xCloud for the occasional gaming in the room or should I just keep a console that was made for gaming and not streaming?",XboxSeriesX,8,0.57

Did I make the right decision?,"On an impulse, I dropped 699 (Singapore dollars) on the Xbox Series X pre-order. The retailer was running a promo with my credit card (25 bucks off plus a month of Xbox All Access). I was holding off on buying another console coz I just built a new PC in the hope of getting the next gen of graphics cards. But guys. Seriously the price delta is just no Bueno.

I dropped around a grand to build almost from the ground up (I had some leftover SATA SSDs, and an old GTX 970) and it's a great daily driver / straightforward 1080p gaming...

But honestly I think going Xbox was the right choice. The exclusives game is getting interesting with the Bethesda acquisition and even without it I think Microsoft's strategy is fundamentally different from PS5 or even playing on a PC, plus I have a 4K TV...

Indie games needs a bit more recognition,"No rant no complaints. Just a bit of discussion.
So as a pc gamer with not so amazing specs (6th gen i7 Gtx1060) I fell in love with indie games. Not only are they cheap but I didn't need to care about graphics and frame rate issues. And so many choices. No loot boxes, DLCs, constant patches etc.. All in all indie games are amazing. Plus it's fascinating how many amazing games a small team or an individual can make. 

I am very pleased that xbox has something called ID@xbox and is supporting indie but still most of the indie games I see not many of them.. There are so many games like project Winter. Among trees and of course among us that must come to xbox.

I just wanna discuss the future of xbox towards indie games. Can we expect to see more freedom like steam? And I feel Microsoft store should also categorise indie games better. Many games are missing under indie. Many that are in gamepass doesn't appear in that list. And many big company games also appear under indie.

With all this talk of gamepass, Xbox having the beast deal in gaming, all their first party studio games coming to gamepass, them buying Bethesda, smart delivery, awesome upfront backwards compatibility, and so on, I've been thinking about getting an Xbox Series X a little later down the road once there's more available everywhere and hopefully a price cut or some awesome bundle comes out.

Appreciation post from India to Microsoft for paying attention to us.,"I live in India, and last-gen was a mess, Xbox release 1yr after the worldwide release, and PS4 released 6 months after the release.

But this time everything has been changed, currently, we do not even have confirmed pricing for PS5 in our country, no preorder or anything as well and it is already pushed back from worldwide release date, but on the flip side, Xbox has announced the price, started and ended the preorder (sold out in 10mins flat) via digitally &amp; local retailers (local retailers selling console is a big deal as it is not a norm here). And We have the same release date as world wide (which makes us in line with Australia &amp; NZ, somewhat 15hours before the worldwide release).

It's just feels so good that gamers in India are finally being paid attention to and being treated same as all the other places. I have successfully secured a preorder for X as well via a local retailer.

Pre Order COD Cold War xbox one or XSX version?,"Hi everyone I have an XSX pre order in and want to get the new COD but I was wondering if anyone had thoughts on the cross generation deal.

Target has:
Xbox one versions for $59.99 + 10% video game discount + 5% Red Card + 5% target circle coupon. This drops the price to $52 after tax for me.

XSX version for $69.99 same as above except no 10% video game discount which comes out to $70ish after tax

I’m still on the fence on which one to get due to the price hike lol

Edit: looks like XSX is the one I’m getting since COD isn’t offering free gen upgrade. Thanks for the response.",XboxSeriesX,17,0.74

I really hope the game clip system (especially in regards to editing) is completely overhauled for the XSX.,"Don’t get me wrong, MS has made huge strides in terms of making the UI as fast and fluid as possible, however game clips seem to have been forgotten.

At the moment it’s a complete mess imo. Trimming clips is laggy, and when you are finished and it tries to render, it gets stuck at about 75% done, and just stays on an infinite load screen. I don’t understand how the world’s most powerful console’s system struggles to complete a very basic function. 

You also have game clip uploading to Xbox live which seems to take upwards of half an hour, sometimes longer in my experience. Surely this should be a matter of seconds, minutes at most. 

There is also Upload Studio which has not seen any updates in months. I really loved utilising that when it first came out but then they seemed to give up on it. 

It would be great if they could streamline this whole aspect more so it actually works in terms of editing and uploading.

Do you think we can download XSS versions of games to the XSX?,"I pre-ordered an XSX because I want to have a disc drive and larger storage. However, I don't have or plan on buying a 4k TV.

I know Smart Delivery is a thing so it would be great to give XSX players the option to decide between larger textures or smaller file size.

I tried to return to Xbox this upcoming gen,"UK folk who pre ordered from Smyths, or more to the point, those who pre ordered the Series X All Access package, have you had your order cancelled yet again? Seems a fair few folk have.

I initially ran into the now infamous  pre order fiasco that both Smyths and GAME had on Tuesday, where you got sent the Direct Debit and got a hard credit check on your credit file, but you couldn't check out.

Smyths then attempted to re launch the pre order scheme yesterday (Wednesday 23/09) and all seemed well again.  The order went through. Second hard credit check from the finance company involved, but i got the product and whilst annoyed, accepted it.  Today got a cancellation from Smyths because they seemed to have screwed up again.  So now, no pre order and a battered and bruised credit report with zero to show for it. 

I like many people swapped over to PS last gen for reasons we all know, so no point dragging that up, but after hearing MS/Xbox go on about their much hyped All Access package I decided to return to Xbox.  I wish I hadn't bought into their hype nor do I intend to return.  I've had less grief buying houses than pre ordering an inane piece of electrical equipment. 

I think my point is, MS should have had this bundle available on their own website rather than relying solely on the car crashes that are both GAME and Smyths. Their websites aren't fit for purpose. I'm not actually too bothered about not getting the console, but I do admit I'm salty asf about my credit file being trashed. MS have to take some responsibility for that. They chose the retailers, they chose the finance company and it was their much lauded finance package that have caused many people needless stress. Where the actual problem lies, I dunno.

I get it, I am but one person.  Won't make a difference if i buy one of their products or not, but needed to vent anyway.  Feel free to tell me how I should just sit back and stfu and accept it.",XboxSeriesX,20,0.61

I took my lunch at 4AM and decided to check out my store for numbers and if a line started yet (work is a few minute drive to my GameStop).  Pulled in and found a lone shivering soul sitting on the ground, Rusty had been there since 2AM.  The door said 5x and 1s, ugh.

As I was walking back to my car, I looked back to Rusty sitting on the cold ground and remembered I had my chairs in the car.  So I pulled out the two chairs I had and gave them to him to use. Told him hopefully I’d be back in time to get a spot, and to let someone use the other chair if they needed it. As I was pulling out, Rusty waived me down. He told me his mom was coming to sit with him and save my spot till I got back.  I was absolutely overjoyed!  I had a spot in line and didn’t have to spend the rest of my shift in a near panic.  I went back to the store straight after work, low and behold I count 6 people waiting for the 6 consoles.  I get out of my car, Rusty’s mom jumps up from the second spot in line and gives it to me.

Xbox how do you incentivize and put pressure on individual game developer studios to be better then everyone else under game pass? Where is the capitalist approach to win a market for a individual game when no one is buying a game directly with game pass?,"Assuming Gamepass becomes what a majority of Xbox users subscribe to, what puts pressure on a developer if a majority of their customers will be playing the game through game pass. A capitalist approach would be to compete with other game developers to win the customer but now if no one is paying directly for a game under game pass what drives or incentivizes a game developer to be better than everyone else? 

Also under a game pass type of ecosystem would that encourage game developers to utilize micro transactions because people won’t be buying the game directly?

My favorite game developer is Bethesda game studios. I would hate to see that studio become relaxed by not having to compete with say obsidian over customers dropping $60. Since no one is directly buying their game with game pass I fear it could decrease pressure to be better or more innovative than other rpg game developers. I just hope that Bethesda game studios will continue to push themselves and make amazing content better then the competition and not fall in the mindset of having a safety net “gamepass” incase they fail or don’t exceed expectation.",XboxSeriesX,26,0.21

Series S memory,"Hello, so I have a Series S on pre-order and I just wanted to make sure I am right about the memory situation. From what I understand, I can use any USB 3.1 storage device to hold any games not designed for the Series S and play them from the hard drive. However, if I want to be able to have extra storage for new games, it has to be on the console or on the Seagate SSD hard drive? My plan is to keep any new games that come out on the console and then older ones from Games Pass on an external hard drive. I just wanted to check that if I got say, an old COD game, it would not count as a next gen game if I get it on the console, so I could store it and play it from the USB 3.1 hard drive?

Who else with a failed All Access preorder just got a Citizens One alert about their new line of credit?,"Absolute fucking disaster lol. 

I tried to grab a Series X on Gamestop yesterday via All Access (since it would be more convenient for me to space out the payments instead of paying all at once). I was under the assumption that a certain number of consoles were being held separately, so that people would have enough time to get through the credit line application and grab a preorder. 

I successfully completed the Citizens One credit line application but, after getting approved by Citizens One, hit the ""SORRY WE'RE OUT OF STOCK NOW!"" error on Gamestop and thus didn't get my All Access preorder in. An hour or so later, Citizen One's credit check shows up as a hard pull on Equifax, which is irritating considering it didn't actually serve a purpose. 

Today, I've now received an email from Citizens One that my line of credit is **active ($2,500 lol)** and my online portal is ready for activation. I just got off the phone with Citizens One customer service who claim the account will be deactivated in 30 days and allege the account deactivation won't hurt my credit score, but still — this fuckin sucks!

KEY TAKEAWAYS  
Do not try to order an Xbox with the All Access program if there's any risk of consoles going out of stock during the process. I imagine this risk will persist for the remainder of preorders and holiday shopping. (And avoid applying for a payment plans for any electronic devices, because getting a line of credit for one product alone involves risks like this and is also unfortunately kind of dumb)",XboxSeriesX,38,0.88

"Xbox Series - S - It would be a great 1440p console, but...","If you're sold on the idea of 1440p gaming? I wouldn't get too excited.

Xbox One - X has demonstrated that the level of 1440p support we receive, on the Xbox, is only as far as 1440p native display support.  The  majority of games, if any, DO NOT support / output 1440p. This has been a problem for 3 years now. Developers seldom choose to support 1440p...this is odd because the Xbox One - X  has a great and capable 1440p GPU and NEVER should have been forced into 4K.

Case-in-point? Consoles have always had this problem. With vendors refusing to believe that a LARGE part of the community runs standard PC monitors to game off of...and not necessarily 40-72 inch TVs (try easily getting one of these into a dorm)  with standardized timings and only a handful of resolutions (480, 720, 1080 and 4K resolution). So while you can definitely go into the Xbox settings and set your display to 1440p? Your games will still be forced to upscale 1080p to your 1440p display, which looks hella ugly, or VSR/ downsample 4K output onto 1440p, which does look nice. As far as native 1440p? That is up to the developers to throw in and they are not incentivized to do so.",XboxSeriesX,13,0.27

It's very clear what Microsoft is trying to do here and it is going to pay off big time.,"The most powerful next gen console on the market. For the hardcore gamer and enthusiast and for those who want to make the most out of their high resolution and refresh rate displays.

The most affodable next gen console on the market. Good option for those on a budget, wanting to get a second console, casual gamers, and those looking to buy a family console or for their kid/s. 

Xbox Game Pass. The netflix of gaming. Gives consumers access to a huge library of third party games and day 1 access to first party releases for an incredibly affordable price.

Xcloud. Tapping into the mobile market. Giving access to an enormous line-up of third party and first party library of games for an affordable price and able to be played on mobile and tablet devices. Xbox is also committed to bring this to iOS.

23 first party studios. They are deticated to publishing many high budget and quality first party games that will sell consoles, and/or gamepass. And they have expressed that they may purchase more studios too.

PC support. Releasing first party games on PC, and offering gamepass on PC, along with amazing consumer friendly programs like play anywhere, cross-progression, and cross-play support expands the ecosystem to PC gamers.

Adaptive controller. Expands accessibility to gaming to people with disabilities. 

Multi-gen backwards compatibility. Makes it easier to move on to subsequent generation consoles and retain game libraries and purchases from past generations. Makes it easier and more affordable to keep gamers engaged and loyal to the ecosystem. 

Accessory compatibility. Similar to the above, makes it easier and more affordable to upgrade to subsequent generation, allowing consumers to bring forward most of their accessories rather than being forced to buy new products.

Conclusion - It is very clear what Xbox is trying to achieve and, in a way, it started with the xbox one but that was implemented and executed poorly. Phil Spencer and his team has definitely managed to turn it around and execute what has clearly been Microsoft's vision for the future... and that is catering to and covering every corner of the gaming industry as a whole. 

There are over 2 billion gamers in the world. While many outlets have declared victory in the past based on how many consoles a company has sold, consoles alone only reach a fraction of the gaming population as a whole. Microsoft realises this and is using its financial power to not only expand it's reach, but do so aggressively at every level. 

Ive heard people say Sony is primarily trying to sell consoles and Microsoft is primarily trying to sell gamepass. That's simply wrong. They have both the most powerful and most affordable consoles on the market along with 23 first party studios. Microsoft is primarily trying to sell everything: consoles, gamepass, xcloud, games. 

They have a long term strategy and it's going to pay off big time. 

Sony will be fine this generation, but they don't seem to be prepared for what Microsoft is going to achieve over the course of the next 10+ years.",XboxSeriesX,10,0.84

Why I feel it’s smarter to start with Xbox for this generation,"I’ve been heavily considering both the Xbox and PS5 for a while now. I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, the Xbox is simply the better console to start with for this generation and that I’ll likely pick up a PS5 much later on. Here’s why. 

Game Pass Ultimate presents an amazing bang for your buck. Why pay $10 a month for PS+ to simply play online when you can pay $15 to play online, have access to all first party exclusives on day one without having to purchase them, and be able to play games on the go with Xcloud? 

With the Series X, you can also play all of your multi platform games at the highest console fidelity. I don’t see the point in playing them on the PS5 especially when cross play is starting to become standard. The argument of playing with your friends on a specific platform will eventually become void. 

The PS5 has some absolutely amazing first party exclusive games. There’s no doubt about that. However, most of these are single player, story driven games. In my case, I’d play through them thoroughly enough one time and hardly ever touch them again. I couldn’t justify paying full price for these games. It makes more sense to wait for a mid generation console refresh, pick up a PS5 slim, and then snatch these games for $20-30 with all the patches and DLCs bundled. 

These are my thoughts on the two consoles. Id love to see your opinions or any other points you’d like to add.",XboxSeriesX,37,0.81

"MS/Xbox, Zenimax/Bethesda, Sony/PS5 and the future?","Hi...I tried posting this in r/xbox but was not allowed. I hope you don't mind me posting here.

Anyway I've been thinking about this on and off since the big announcement. Just a few days ago I was deadset on getting the PS5 (I'm a current PS4 Pro owner), but Sony's mixed messaging, lack of exclusives which I want to play, Xbox Game Pass and MS's purchase has me leaning towards an Xbox Series X (I'll likely still get a PS5 once the good exclusives come out). Whilst making my decision I thought of the following possibilities - would like to know what you all think.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Maybe MS and Sony come to some sort of quid pro quo agreement, e.g. ""We'll give you Starfield if you give us XXX"" - this is inline with Phil's vision of opening gaming up to everyone. If Sony fully leverages the PS5's haptic controller, SSD and Tempest 3D so that the best playing experience for their 1st party games is on the PS5, they'll have less to worry about. I can kind of see this happening. Maybe they'll have Minimum Advertised prices, e.g. ""If I let you have this game you can only sell it for $##"" thus ensuring accessibility but a guaranteed cheaper price on their own platform. I really don't know. But if it happens I think it would be a win for MS.
2. Maybe timed exclusives for MS. The games will be on Xbox/GP then *maybe* allowed to PS5. I just don't see this happening though. I really don't see MS giving up their games just for cash. If so, why buy Zenimax in the first place? Why not just come to an agreement to always have their games on GP? MS bought ownership for a reason.
3. Sony/PS5 pays for access. Somewhat the inverse of timed exclusives. So instead of paying to have a game earlier than MS, Sony pays just to have any access at all. Again I don't see this happening, MS is not in this just for money. They're pursuing something grander.
4. MS shares nerfed / inferior game quality, e.g. 1080/1440p for PS5, 4k for Xbox. To me this is an interesting strategy. MS has already set the table with the Series S. Maybe they give the Series S versions to PS5 to fulfil the ""opening gaming up for everyone"" but keep the 4k to themselves and Game Pass. I'm not sure if Sony can do the same, i.e. offer nerfed versions of their exclusives. Or if they would even want to.

These were only my thoughts - I've no evidence either way and I'm also sure there are other scenarios. It would be interesting if Scenario 1 or 4 happens though.

In a few years I think VR may be the only thing that saves console gaming.,"* Amazon Luna $30 Firestick, PC/Mac, Phone
* Google Stadia $30 Chromecast, PC/Mac, Mobile 
* Microsoft Xcloud 
* Nvidia GeForce Now
* Sony PSNow
* Apple Game Service

I get the objections to latency issues, library issues, etc. Here's why I don't think these will stop the sea change that is about to happen. 

The  biggest server companies in the world are now competing to deliver games as a service on streaming devices that encompass mobile, computer, smart TVs and dirt cheap streaming TV devices. They work with controllers from any game system and they cost $6-$15 a month. These services will be available to the masses. Amazon will promote on Twitch, FireTV. Google will promote on YouTube and Google TV devices. Apple will promote on Apple TV and iOS devices. 

The competition to improve the quality of these services over the next few years is going to be intense. 4K 120 will be possible and you will even see a teraflops race on the server side. Microsoft Xcloud is already one-upping Google's Stadia teraflops next year. 

I know it seems like this tech is far away still from console quality, but a competition has just started between the biggest tech/cloud companies in the world. The console wars of this generation will be a sidebar of the game streaming wars. This could be the last generation of consoles. 

The only hardware they sell that will matter will be the streaming stick and the controller. 

Beyond that what devices will require additional hardware? VR? Motion controllers? Cameras?

Why the Xbox Series S is fine,"Let's look at what the Series S actually is and the implications for game development.

The Series S has the same CPU as the Series X but at 200 Mhz lower frequency; a negligible difference. It has the same SSD speed. The RAM is half as fast with 6GB less capacity, and the GPU is about a third as powerful as the Series X. What I believe is actually going to happen is that games for Series X|S will be first designed around the Series X, with textures then down scaled and internal resolution lowered for the Series S version. This will not be a problem for developers. The engine runs on the CPU, and any SSD asset streaming will also be unaffected. The RAM and GPU bottlenecks can easily be accounted for by first lowering resolution of textures and internal resolution rendering, then lowering sampling level of effects, and then in the worst case scenario just setting a lower frame rate target for the S in case the target is 60 FPS or higher on the X.

I was originally thinking the memory performance parity will be a huge problem, but based on the information we know I've reasoned that Xbox games will *not* need to be built around the S as the baseline, rather may around the X, as scaling down for assets and resolution is quite easy compared to readjusting the entire game for a weaker CPU (which again is not the case here). People who buy the S knowing it's unprecedently cheap for a launch Xbox console will be ok with this situation; they know they were making a small sacrifice for a smaller and cheaper device. Xbox has shown it will have good value this generation. 

I wrote this post because I'm sure there are many of you like me who were nervous about the Series S situation, and not only it potentially holding back Xbox Series X but possibly the entire console generation. I firmly believe this will not be the case. Thanks!",XboxSeriesX,23,0.44

I’m sure All Access will be worked out by then and we’ll be able to get the product if we are already approved. If not then the credit drop should be gone by then if I’m not mistaken.

Game Pass makes it so review scores no longer matter.,"I’ll preface this by saying yes, I’m sure reviews don’t matter to a good chunk of people.

I have always been someone who loves reviews. I love getting different opinions on something to direct my purchases for any game.

If a game gets a sub-80 Metacritic, I’ll always be hesitant to sink in 
money and time into something that mightn’t be up to scruff.

What Xbox have done with Game Pass is completely eliminate this fear for me. I can make my own opinions on a game without it hurting my wallet, &amp; if I’m not keen on it I can just bounce.

If I think something looks even remotely for me, I can give it a try, no hassle.

Recently played Sunset Overdrive, and after an hour or two just decided it wasn’t my jam and swerved it off. &amp; I didn’t have to feel bad about spending money.

The other week I preordered a PS5, but don’t think I can justify one at the minute with all the negatives PlayStation are coming up with at the minute, so I think an upgrade from my Xbox One X to a Series X is definitely on the cards.

2- How does the pay $1 to convert gold to ultimate work? I've seen many people talk about it and I'm confused. Let's say I buy 3 months of gold and activate it when I get my Series S and I can just pay $1 to convert those 3 gold months into ultimate ones?

It was a miracle,"First of all, I’m sorry for anyone who did NOT get an XSX or XSS. My condolences, and I can empathize with the feeling. 

At any rate, I have to tell this story about my awesome wife. She isn’t really a gamer, and her use of the Xbox is mostly TV streaming related. So her interest is mostly to help me get the new Xbox, because she knows I want one.

First of all we both got ready early to head to a physical GameStop store and got there at about 6am PST. There were a few people in line already and it looked like a fair amount of them were “together”. And  so, we figured we would probably still snag one.

After waiting for almost 2 hours the GS employee handed out the claim Numbers for the XSX and XSS (7 and 2 respectively).  The people that were “together” ALL got one, 7 in a row. 

My wife and I were there together but only were going to get 1, so I guess we thought they were the same... we thought wrong! So it was 7:45 PST, and we scrambled our butts to our car and sat there waiting for the online sales to go live.

8:00 came, I had the BestBuy app open (with my card info already pre-loaded) and my wife pulled up Target’s website... refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh... in the cart, Waaaaiiiiit... OUT OF STOCK, on Target.

BestBuy’s didn’t seem to go live until well after 9:00AM PST. By this time we were both already at work and I work in the field and my wife at a desk. Well, after checking BestBuy periodically, it finally went live at around 9:25AM. Refresh, refresh, refresh, add to cart, refresh, checkout, refresh, refresh, place order.... place order... place order (repeat infinitely)

OUT OF STOCK.

(As it turns out both my wife and I, separately, were both on BestBuy’s site trying to get one and both failed.)

Welp, seemed like our last chance had run out. It’s okay because there’ll be more pre-order drops and it’s honestly not the end of the world. We were pretty bummed anyways.

1 hour 30 mins later, it’s 11AM. I had long forgotten the failure of the morning and had gotten on with work. I get a phone call from my wife, which isn’t unusual as she calls me for work often (family business). She says

Her:  “Who do you love?”

Me: trying not to be hopeful “what’s going on?”

Her: “I got a Xbox from BestBuy!

Me: “No way! How?”

Her: “I just figured I’d check again, maybe someone’s payment didn’t go through and we could still snag one, and it must’ve worked!”

"Xbox has completely revived itself from the dead in the last two years, but it still has a small yet glaring issue"," Idfk why even F2P games need Xbox live gold, I mean there's a reason they're called F2P games. And I don't know why Xbox is so petty that they're still locking F2P games behind a paywall. Now I don't have a Xbox one, I play on PC but I've seen Xbox locking games like apex or fortnite behind gold. This is just not good. I'm happy that they're offering a lot of value for their subscriptions. I believe that gamepass offers an insane value for 10-15$. I'm happy to play flight simulator 2020, the outer worlds, subnautica, Ori and Halo MCC using gamepass for my PC. And they're just giving us so much more by teaming up with EA play and giving us all Bethesda titles too on gamepass and offering us a mostly practical way of streaming games. But this doesn't change the fact that they're still locking games behind a paywall which even Sony or even greedy Nintendo gives you for free. This is honestly such a dick move and I don't think anyone benefits from it. I'll soon switch to a series X and I will pay for gamepass ultimate. It's very much worth the price for 10$. But please, Xbox, don't force me to pay you up! How much ever the value the gamepass offers, some people won't just be able to afford it. 10-15$ a month for a subscription isn't really cheap even in my eyes. Many people would consider it expensive, even considering the insane value it offers. And these people usually play f2p games too. Hell most people atleast play one f2p battleroyale now. But forcing these people to pay up isn't really effective at all. You're hardly going to extract money that way. You'll just make these people resent you. It Xbox/microsoft is rich enough to buy up one of the largest gaming studios in the industry for 7.5 billion $, can't they bear the cost of hosting some players on f2p games on their servers? This is just downright petty. I hope Xbox fixes this but I guess nobody will understand this post and call me some kind of Sony fanboy.",XboxSeriesX,9,0.33

Xbox Gamepass business model - How do publishers monetize the service?,"I know the details are locked down but I've seen some of them leak out. My understanding is that there is a lump sum for agreeing to bring your game to the service, at least for some titles. And then afterward, I'm guessing there is a chunk of the total revenue which is divided up among the titles which are listed in game pass and that is paid out based on play hours. Since the revenue comes in on a monthly basis, it makes sense to me they would go this route.

I like this because its really a performance based situation, if you put a massive title like COD in there and tons of people play it, they get the lions share of the money. Maybe not as much as releasing it stand alone but you also get the chance to acquire new customers you wouldn't have had otherwise which has positive secondary benefits.

If you are a small indie who happens to put out a really awesome game, you get rewarded with huge money.  It would seem to me that companies would stand to gain by letting people know their title is in Gamepass to increase their play hours. With Microsoft's shift to active users and play time metrics, it seems to fall in line with expectations.

Is this a good monitor for Destiny 2 PVP on the new Xbox Series X?,"First post on this thread so apologies if I'm breaking any rules.

I'm looking to purchase a new monitor for:

* Xbox Series X (no PC)
* I just use a regular Xbox controller (no mouse and keyboard)
* I only play Destiny 2 (might play the new Halo in the future)
* I really only care about speed and performance (visual aesthetics and graphics not so much).

I'm not very good when it comes to this stuff, but I've heard 1ms and 144hz are really the biggest things to focus on for competitive FPS performance on console?  If so, I was thinking this could be a good monitor for competitive Destiny 2 on the new Xbox Series X?

The problem isn't the fact people sell their xbox series x on ebay. The problem is the fact that idiots are willing to pay for it.,"So if you didn't got your pre order for the xbox series x just please wait a month before you buy it fron a stranger on ebay. A month is probably the maximum to wait I think. 

But if you do buy it on ebay you show that the console is worth more. This is also happening with new rtx 3080. People online are buying an rtx 3080 for a max of 2500 dollars. People that buy it for that much are the reason that the next rtx card will coat even more because nvidea knows how much some people will pay for it. 

The same goes with everyother pre order in the world. So i want to adjust to everyone, if you are buying a xbox series x and than sell it to make profit your an asshole. If you buy it from someone for more than its worth than your a fucking dumbass. 

If you want it so badly please just wait a month its not like your going to remember that first month and be like omg know that month i got the new xbox when some people didn't that was amazingg. Thats not going to be the case, just wait a little bit.

"As someone who has secured both a PS5 and an Xbox Series X, neither 'process' was better than the other.","Yes, Sony's 'SURPRISE!' pre order tactic was incredibly infuriating to those that weren't preemptively refreshing pages just in case they dropped the pre order after their online showcase, but the staggered retailers showing up here and there, with little warning at different times was actually conducive to sites staying stable and folks who were attempting to get one not succumbing to Web based issues.  

Microsoft's 'Everyone go to these sites at this exact time!' approach went exactly how we expected it. Sites buckled under the sheer weight of traffic, consoles didn't appear on every site at the same time anyway (some here in the UK still haven't gone live), confirmation emails have gone missing, delivery methods have been botched and as a result, most of those who took every possible precaution to make sure they were in place to order one at 8am this morning, have still been left not knowing if they will get one for launch.  

Both methods were flawed. Nothing was put in place by individual sites to combat the weight of traffic, to make queueing fair or to prevent bots. I know these events don't come around often but surely, in 2020, there must be a better way to go about things than this.  

For me, the best method was ShopTo.net. They prioritised pre-orders based on when you registered your interest in the product. Even that's not perfect but its a start.  

Did you get one? How was the experience for you? I managed to get one by chance on Amazon at 8:15am when they inexplicably appeared suddenly. The whole thing was exhausting and stressful.",XboxSeriesX,103,0.69

They are the exception certainly but there are a bunch of them. I mean, there will be 20 auctions where the Xbox Series X will for $800-850 and sprinkled throughout there will be 3 or 4 that are bid up to $2200 or even $4000. I don't get it.

Answers from CitizenOne for those who were approved but couldn't buy,"I just got off the phone with CitizenOne and this is the information I was given. I recommend you also all call as this deals with your credit, but wanted everyone to be in the know.

I was approved for this through the Microsoft Store.


1. If you were approved, a line of credit now exists for you in the amount that you would have owed. You do not currently owe anything on this.


2. If no action is taken in 150 days, this line of credit will be closed.


3. A hard inquiry was placed on your credit for this approval. It will remain on your credit for 2 years.


4. (I dont think this one is correct, but im only reporting what I was directly told from the representative.) If you do not get it from the retailer you were approved by, another hard inquiry will occur at the time of getting approved by that retailer.


5. (I also don't think this is correct) The original retailer may cause another hard inquiry if you have not made your order in 30 days.


Overall, incredibly frustrating. There should have been some way to help prevent this on Microsofts part when dealing with consumers credit, even if that way was to not allow people to attempt to pre-order. Im mostly mad at myself, because in hindsight it should have been obvious this may happen.

I re-iterate, I recommend that you call CitizensOne yourself and record the date, time, and name of your representative in case you need to dispute anything on your credit.

So... I just ordered my very first Xbox...,"I'm excited right now! I have been a self-proclaimed Sony-only enthusiast since my original PSX. I have always been partial to the exclusive games that were on PS and because of that, I had only ever come close to pre-ordering the 360 at EB Games years ago, only to convert it to a credit towards a PS game right before release.

I have always had a growing library of Xbox games at the back of my head that I would want to play one day, and I told myself that if the Next-Gen Xbox was backward compatible, I'd purchase both systems this gen. Having missed my shot at a PS5, I was determined to not make that mistake today. I'm happy to say that I have the confirmation from Microsoft that my Series X order was successful!

So here is where I need some help. I have never owned an Xbox, but I am vaguely familiar with a few things I may need. For one thing, I know the controller's are usually not rechargeable. Meanwhile, I have always had a charging stand for my controllers from the PS3 days. What do seasoned Xbox owners recommend? Are there other accessories I should be aware of?

While we are at it, any must-play games you recommend? Definitely interested in couch co-op style games in addition to single-player as my wife and I game on occasion. I do prefer to own physical copies of games, but I intend to subscribe to game pass in order to dive into some of the older games in my wishlist.

Looking forward to being a part of the Xbox family.

Edit:

I appreciate the conversations everyone has been having with me. If anyone else is about to reply, I am also curious about the ability to use headphones to play without sound coming from the TV.

Is preorder price higher? Will it go down after launch?,"Hi, usually technology in my country costs as much as the dollar price in my currency + maybe the 10% of the price, which is decent. For example I bought a the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ a month ago for a price lower than the amazon listing price.

But in the case of the Xbox, it is costing much more. Retailers and the official Xbox page for my country cost much more (like 30% than the retail price) and I am wondering if maybe its just because of the preorder, and the actual console will be a little cheaper one or two weeks after lauch, also considering black friday is comming and retailers in my country do offer decent dicounts on this date as well, can I expect it to be a little cheaper?

Educated guess for when $1 game pass ultimate deal will expire?,"Will be getting the XSX on release day and have never had a gold or game pass account before. Planning to buy 3 months of gold and do the $1 upgrade, but would prefer to wait until closer to Nov 10th. Is there any info out there about how long the deal will last? Would hate to miss out on the deal but don’t want to pay for 2 months when I can’t use it. 

Thanks for any advice or input! My Google search didn’t pay off, and I also understand the answer may be that only people who work at MS know.

I have a bias towards Xbox for the memories and experiences over the past 20+ years. Please help me build some hype for the Series X launch day as I am underwhelmed and don't want to be..🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,"I love the Xbox brand. I moved over from my teens on PlayStation to Xbox and have loved everything about the brand since. I've kept up with the other consoles, Switch Ps3/4. But my Xboxes have been the consoles I have had to have day 1. I have the day edition Xbox phat, I have a day one S and a scorpio edition X. But something about the Series X feels more akin to the scorpio upgrade than a new generation. Which is fine, I get the strategy to keep the UI standardised across generations and even games being cross gen really doesn't bother me. But the features and launch package just aren't there for me. 
My Day one Xbox launch bundle was:

Assassins creed black flag.

Dead rising 3.

Cod Ghosts

Ryse son of rome

Zoo tycoon.


Along side this I got new features like voice commands, snap, TV throughput etc. It was an exciting day, full of surprises. Some Good, some really wonky! But it was there.

Now I am looking at Assassins creed Valhalla. Thats all. No new features. I have yet to be shown how Ray tracing and load times are actually implemented. I saw a video of load times from outer worlds, thats it. Unless I upgrade my TV I won't get anything over 60frames, and 120 will be limited to indie side scrollers mostly anyway. My X runs everything it can in 4k hdr, that will be the same. And we've yet to be shown how hdr will work being applied to every title. 

I don't want to come off as Xbox bashing, far from it. I love gamespass, i love how gamer focused Xbox vision is. I love the recent Bethesda acquisition and really like the look of the games they've got in the pipe. But its just that launch day feel. I know I'm going to hook the series x up and log in and not really feel anything different to if I was logging in on the scorpio. If assassins creed was going to blow me away they would be showing it off, but the lack of demonstration makes me wonder how advantageous all this extra power is for the First 12 month, and without new user features its just not getting my day one motor running! I managed to secure a pre order as I believe Xbox will undoubtedly show something in the next month which will blow me away. But if any of you have any ideas or plans that are creating that day one buzz I would to hear them in the hopes of being inspired👍😁👌

"So, if you pre-ordered an Xbox Series X/S today, what was it like?","I'd just like to know how it was for other people who managed to get a Series X/S.

For me it was: I forgot pre-orders are today, remembered 20 minutes after they came out. Looked at gamestop, amazon, target, and ms store but they were all sold out. Saw that it wasn't even on Best Buy at all. Eventually later in the day I remembered, checked best buy, and it was finally available.

Does it matter what HDMI cable we use for the Series X?,"I'm not much of a display person and with my current setup I want to buy a 10-15ft HDMI cable since the ones that come with the console are probably not going to be long enough.

So there's lots of talk about up to 120fps and resolution. I've been looking on Amazon and the cables are filled with marketing like '4K@60FPS,' '2K@144HZ,' 'HIGH SPEED,' '2.0 vs 2.1,' etc.

This just confuses me but some of what I've read says that refresh rate doesn't matter at all for the cable (and that HDMI only supports 60hz?), and that anything above is handled by the display.

So is it as long as it's an HDMI 2.0/2.1 and high speed it should all work the same? If I happen to have a 4K TV with a refresh rate of 120Hz, and as long as the Series X is capable of running the game at 120fps at 4K, it's perfectly fine?",XboxSeriesX,10,1.0
If I pre-load games like Assassins Creed Valhalla and Destiny 2 Beyond Light on my external hard drive. Will they automatically be Series X enhanced when I plug my hard drive into my Series X or do I need to re-download them when I get the console?,Just wanted to clarify if you’re supposed to buy a “Series X|S enhanced” version of the game. I’m assuming that I can have AC Valhalla pre-ordered on my One X or if I should just wait to pre order and buy it when I get the new console. Just a little confusing.,XboxSeriesX,8,0.99

Seems like all access isnt actually intended for what some(🙋‍♂️) think it is.,"Not salty or anything like that but, hear me out. 

I kind of think part of the reason they promoted all access so heavily was because of covid and people maybe not being able to afford the entire cost of a console during the holiday this year. That being said, it still seems you need a 700+ credit score to be approved. I mean, I got a $140K loan for a house last year and have a credit in the mid 600s. 3 and a half years straight of on time payments. No derogatory remarks. No hard inquiries since last year when I was getting a loan for my house. And still failed to pre qualify.

It doesnt always go hand in hand but, if you've got a 700+score,  statistics will probably show you're more likely to be able to afford the console outright than you are with a lower score. Of course they're not just going to give a loan to anyone but, I figured 650ish would be high enough. RIP to my dreams haha. I'll just have to try and snag one before christmas.",XboxSeriesX,13,0.74

Billions of dollars in Game Pass Ultimate Subscriptions.,"With 15 million subscribers, Microsoft brings in 225 million dollars each month off GPU subscribers. Which is roughly 2.7 billion dollars a year. If that number continues to increase, as it shall, the incentive for Microsoft is to continue to make bigger deals to bring more ground breaking games to game pass bringing in more subscribers and revenue. Console sales will follow. And it’s win win for both consumers and producers. What a brilliant business plan, I feel as though it will really take off from this point forward. Comparing to Sony’s model of charging 70 dollars for 1st party games, it will be a lot cheaper to play Xbox game studios 1st party games than Sony’s through GPU. Sony does have excellent games, but who knows if they will continue at that caliber, Xbox sure is not staying silent nor passive.

I don't own any consoles but I really appreciate what Microsoft did this year for all console gamers around the world.,"Both the xbox and ps5 are selling at a low price than what they are actually worth, only difference is that Microsoft had this in their mind and planned to cover this loss without making the customer pay more to enjoy their console with the Xbox Game Pass.

These consoles are only considered cheap in The US but it's not the same case in other parts of the world, in fact many countries (especially third world countries) officially sell these consoles bundled with a game or two with a free month subscription to either ps plus or xbox gold. This will be the same case next year except anyone buying the xbox will get a game free with it + a free subscription to xbox game pass.",XboxSeriesX,1,0.38

"Beginner's Guide to XSX/XSS, Game Pass, Storage, and More!","Welcome to the Xbox family!

The next generation of consoles is coming, as are tons of questions.

This post provides guides and resources that cover the basics of the current state of Xbox. If you're new to Xbox, read **Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass** first.

Before you proceed, please check the [FAQ tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/faq) or [Info tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/information) from [r/XboxSeriesX](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX) for more information, guides, and helpful links.

# Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass

* **Xbox Live Gold (XBL) (US $9.99 monthly):** Allows online multiplayer. Free games every month through Games with Gold. [Click here to join Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live)
* **EA Play (US $4.99 monthly):** Library of older games published by EA. New games are added 6-9 months after release.
* **Game Pass for PC/Game Pass for Console) (US $9.99 monthly):** Game subscription service providing access to over 200 Microsoft and third-party games. First-party MS games stay forever while third-party titles are timed. Includes EA Play as of Holiday 2020.
* **xCloud** \- Cloud game streaming service for mobile access to select Game Pass titles. Still in Beta and not available as a standalone product.
* **Game Pass Ultimate (GPU) (US $14.99 monthly):** Includes Xbox Live Gold, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, Game Pass for Console, and xCloud in one package.

## Game Pass Ultimate And XBL Conversion For $1

Microsoft currently allows you to convert Xbox Live Gold time and Game Pass for PC or Console time to Game Pass Ultimate time at a 1:1 ratio for either $1 or $14.99, based on your eligibility and up to a maximum of 36 months (three years). The estimated savings for the full three years if you buy XBL at retail price is at least US $359* (corrected).

A loophole in this policy allows you to buy up to three years of XBL, redeem it to your Microsoft account, and convert it to GPU. While you don't have to get three years, you save the most money this way.

* When will this promotion end? **No date confirmed**
* Can I do this if I have before? **Yes**
* Can I do this if I currently have a GPU subscription active? **No, adding XBL to your account converts at a 3/1 ratio**
* Can I do this if I currently have a Game Pass for PC or Console subscription active? **Yes**
* Can I do this without an Xbox? **Yes**
* Can I buy XBL from a different region where it's cheaper? **Yes, but you must use a VPN and you may experience region issues with the code redemptions**
* Can I do this if I am no longer eligible for the $1 promotion price? **Yes, but you must make a one-time US $14.99 payment instead of $1**

**Note:** If the total time (XBL + Game Pass time) in your account is more than 36 months, use a PC to activate the promotion. Any time over the 36 month maximum will **disappear**.

### Instructions

1. On your [Microsoft Account](https://account.microsoft.com/services), turn off any existing recurring billing for Game Pass or XBL.
2. Purchase three 12-month Xbox Live Gold cards for your region from a retailer like Amazon, Microsoft, Costco, CDKeys, or others. **Note:** CDKeys is a ""gray market"" site that sells these cards at steep discounts. They're easy to use and reliable.
3. Visit [redeem.microsoft.com](https://redeem.microsoft.com/) and redeem each XBL key. For each key, turn off the recurring billing toggle before you click **Submit**.
4. Check that you have at least 36 months of time on your account (XBL time + Game Pass time).
5. Visit the [Xbox Game Pass page](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) for your region and click **Join Now**.
6. Click **Join for $1** under *Ultimate*.
7. Follow the prompts and provide your payment information when asked.

You should see that all your Game Pass and XBL time now says *upgraded to Game Pass Ultimate* in your Microsoft account.

# Backwards Compatibility

The new Xbox consoles support all Xbox One titles as well as any Xbox/Xbox 360 titles that are already supported on Xbox One.  
You may experience improvements to load times, framerate, and resolution.

Kinect and headsets with optical sound connectors are not currently supported.

# Expanding Storage

The new Xbox consoles have a storage expansion slot. Currently the only supported storage for this slot is the [Seagate Expansion Card](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-1tb-expansion-card). You can install games here and play them directly from the card.

While pricey, cheaper third-party alternatives are inevitable down the road.

You can also use an external USB HDD or SSD to store Series X or S games that you aren't playing. You can't play these directly from the drives and need to transfer them back to supported storage.

You can use an external drive to play non-enhanced backwards-compatible games from the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox.

For a quick reference, see [this diagram](https://i.imgur.com/AwGKbwu.jpg) (courtesy [u/beateride](https://www.reddit.com/u/beateride)) and [Xbox Expansion Explained](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/24/xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s-custom-storage-solution-primer/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) for more detailed information.

# Xbox All Access

[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access)

Xbox All Access is a monthly payment option which gives you a console and two years of GPU. The Xbox Series S is $24.99 a month and the Xbox Series X is $34.99, in the U.S.

All Access involves opening a line of credit with a local credit issuer through the Microsoft-authorized service provider in your area. This means a credit check that usually impacts your credit score.

To see if All Access is available in your region, see the [supported regions list](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/09/xbox-all-access-expands-to-12-countries-this-holiday/).

# Bethesda Acquistion

There is no confirmation on if Xbox will make Bethesda games exclusive. Phil Spencer said it will be on a ""case-by-case basis"" for console exclusivity.

All Bethesda games are set to be added and launched on Game Pass.

Time to knock sense into people. Zenimax property like Bethesda will be only on Xbox ecosystem. It's not rocket and science. It's business.,"I saw many conversation about many fans who concerned about whether they can play MS PROPERTY games on others platform. The answer is **YES** and **NO**. You can play their game on any platform- **PC/Xbox or Mobile** but it's only in **THEIR Ecosystem** aka MS/Xbox ecosystem. 

The facts of matter is:
- It's not ""exclusive"" or anti consumer/ It's BUSINESS. Take a look at your restaurant, take a look at your house, take a look at Coca and Pepsi or Netflix. No Restaurant or anybody SHARE their secret sauces. If MC Donald, Coca produce their ingrident for their softdrink. Why would they share their invention to others? 

You see the point here? **Xbox want people to drag into their ecosystem**. The **same** way that ALL others company in the world is doing. They own property, they won't share it to others. **What in the world you are living to believe Intel will Produce chip for AMD? Or Netflix content will be on Disney plus** 

Anothers major facts: Console market is less than 10%. PC is 48% and the rest is mobile.  So ""losing"" PS market is NONSENSE. PS fan will be attracted to MS ecosystem if they want to play MS property.  MS are too big like Netflix that they don't care much about console sales, their majority focus right is now is on Cloud. Which mean mostly PC+Mobile which are over 70% of market share.   The ""lost"" in PS or nintendo is NOTHING, compare to what they gain. Fame, Playerbase and Money",XboxSeriesX,25,0.65

Are JRPG (and jap. games in general) fans just a vocal minority?,"We had many exclusive shmups and JRPG on the 360 and nothing on the One. Now the standard narrative is ""They don't sell on Xbox"" but is that really the case?

Nier Automata did really good and BandaiNamco and SquareEnix release all the big titles, Kemco ports all the mobile SNES-style JRPG and we finally got Yakuza, Kingdom Hearts and will get Dragon Quest 11.

Are fans of japanese games just a vocal minority? Every comment section of a new trailer, game reveal or news article is filled with comments of fans who want those games. Genshin Impact releases tomorrow on EVERY platform - except Xbox. Same with Ryza 2 later this year. Wonderful101 remake was announced for Xbox and removed later during the Kickstarter.

Atlus was surprised how good Persona sold on Steam and they want to port more. They still skip Xbox even though Sega sees how well their games do on Gamepass. I'm fine with digital only releases because the print runs are apparently way too big for those niche titles.

My wife won the series x from Taco Bell and I dont know what to do.,"I have not owned a Xbox since my 360 Elite  I jumped over to Playstation and never went back....until now.  I really didn't think I would be joining the Xbox community anytime soon.  Afterall I already have my ps5 pre-ordered.

Some notes on why the Bethesda acquisition happened and what it means for TES/FO and Xbox going forward,"ZeniMax/Bethesda were struggling financially a lot before Microsoft acquired them, that's why the owners were trying to sell the company. It's why Bethesda made Elder Scrolls Online and FO76, why they leaned so hard into microtransactions, and they still weren't financially stable. They needed to be acquired to keep the company's finances solvent and be able to continue making games, Microsoft had the money to support them to continue making great games. Be glad that Microsoft bought it, because the bidder they won against was fucking EA, and EA would have absolutely gutted Bethesda Game Studios and everything else under ZeniMax.

Read more about Bethesda's fragility and the potential for an EA acquisition here if you're interested: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/from-banking-scandal-to-video-game-ceo-to-billion-dollar-score

And more about the volatile nature of the industry leading to Bethesda's troubles here: https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/22/xboxs-bethesda-acquisition-is-evidence-of-blockbuster-gamings-volatility/amp/?__twitter_impression=true


Here's an examination of how games acquisitions have gone in the past, noting that EA is five of these examples and they have consistently completely fucked over acquisitions, so it's fantastic that they didn't get Bethesda/ZeniMax: https://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-12-of-gamings-biggest-studios-after-they-were-sold/

And if you're worried because of the two terrible Microsoft examples in that documentary (Ensemble and Lionhead), here's a fantastic documentary on the development of Halo Wars that tells the full story of why Ensemble shut and it's a lot more complicated than just ""Microsoft closed Ensemble"": https://youtu.be/igaB219Ic8c

As for Lionhead, what ruined them was the Kinect bullshit Microsoft was pulling at the start of the Xbox One generation, with Don Mattrick forcing them into making Kinect games. Absolutely, insanely, terrible decision making. Out of touch with Xbox employees and customers and leading to the worst generation launch of Xbox ever. Microsoft removed Don Mattrick and replaced him with Phil Spencer, who ended the Kinect bullshit and has dramatically improved Xbox. Don Mattrick literally did not care about Xbox (https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1102441475898404864?s=19) and Phil Spencer understands exactly what went wrong with the launch and is committed to not repeating those mistakes (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/). I also find it interesting that if you go back and rewatch that terrible launch, the first time anyone talks about games is 30 minutes in when Phil Spencer shows up to introduce some EA game.

I get why people are worried, and I don't like the industry consolidating or the practice of exclusives either. But Bethesda Game Studios are by far my favourite studios, they were going under without a buyer, and Microsoft outbid EA. EA would have unceremoniously killed TES and Fallout by taking all of the recent Bethesda microtransaction/games as a service shit and turning it up to 11 for every game. At least as Microsoft exclusives, they can make high quality single player games, and the only requirement on the games is that they be desirable enough to drive console sales, aka the games just need to be good, not super profitable, much like God of War.",XboxSeriesX,93,0.94
Let's talk about the other studios a part of the Bethesda deal,"If you are an Xbox fan is been a rollercoaster high week with the acquisition of Bethesda/Zenimax. It has been at this point discussed extensively what the acquisition means debated whether the games will go to other consoles and what the big studios will offer. For Bethesda Softworks, ID Software, Zenimax Online, and to some extent Machine Games and Arkane. We know the IP's: Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Starfield, Doom, Wolfenstein, Dishonored, Evil Within, Quake, and Ghost Wire. 

We know that Arkane is doing Deathloop and working on new IP your guess is as good as mine as to what that is whether they continue Dishonored or do something else. Machine Games could work on new IP after putting out 3 or 4 Wolfenstein games or continue with spin-offs. Tango is locked on Ghostwire and Evil Within. The interesting conversation is Alpha Dog and Roundhouse.

Both are studios that are actually under Bethesda and not independent studios under Zenimax. One is a studio concentrated on mobile games and the other is Human Head re-branded. These are more like support AA studios. There are 3 options for the direction of these studios they stay the same, they stay the same and become support studios, or they grow and shift direction and become studios that do new IP or work on existing Bethesda IP in new ways or Microsoft IP.

   So what am I getting at you have Blades and Fallout Shelter plus current games that are on mobile for Alpha Dog to help Bethesda with and their games. Those are games with tens or hundreds of million players that can go to X Cloud as Shelter is already on Xbox and we may see a new version of that. There is also a huge opportunity for these studios to expand and certain IP that can our huge opportunities to continue on Xbox and now have the manpower and dev assets to plan that out. I am talking of Mech Assault as part of the Battletech Series and Killer Instinct. Mech Assault could be a great direction for Machine Games if they take a break from Wolfenstein but you can get several studios working on a project like that and provide a mech game with an awesome engine and shooting mechanics and invest in the lore and be narrative-driven. Killer Instinct with Roundhouse or help remasters or remake Ryse Son of Rome with Crytek. This is speculation and what I might like to see that can be done. What are yours? What do you think should or will be done with these lesser-known studios or even possibly studios at a crossroads and not as monetarily successful as Bethesda and ID but that can be invested in and have massive potentials like Arkane, Tango, and Machine.

I want him to have his own account so that we can seperate that.  Some questions though.

1. I'm guessing he'd have to re add all his friends and I can boot them off mine.  How would it work for games like Fortnite?  How can I transfer all that to his account?
2. To continue using the One S, I guess I set the X to Home(?) and S as an additional one?
3. Would I set up both of our accounts on each Xbox and then we can just sign in as needed?

Hopefully MS acquisition of Bethesda will be a chance to produce quality RPGs that are more similar to old titles than recent ones.,"I really hope that the acquisition brings new ideas and creativity to the RPG division because I always felt that the quality of the games got worse and worse with each title. 
Beside the micro transaction stuff, I always felt that they kept dumbing down their game to cater to larger audiences. Now with gamepass that problem is over so I really wish they looked at the past rather than the recent games.

Morrowind is by far better than Oblivion, which in turn is better than Skyrim. Of course Skyrim has the prettier graphics, but nothing can beat the sense of immersion and customization that I had with Morrowind. 

Obviously we don’t even have to talk about Falliut 76.., but I always felt that Fallout 3 experience was superior to Fallout 4.

The next Xbox Games Showcase,"This has in my opinion been the overall greatest month in Xbox history. The Series S reveal, price and release reveal, preorders selling out in multiple countries, the success of XCloud, Bethesda acquisition, and now sending units to media outlets for gameplay. 

Xbox has a lot of good momentum right now, and they need to keep their foot on the gas pedal until launch. October would be great month for another games showcase. 

Matt Booty said that we haven’t heard from all studios. From the July Showcase we’ve haven’t seen what’s going on with The Coalition, Mojang, Worlds Edge, InExile, Compulsion, and The Initiative. Plus the newly acquired Bethesda studios. 

I also see this as an opportunity to provide insight on the games from studios we’ve not seen, updates on previously announced titles, as well as GamePass promotions. 

Hypothetically speaking I could see The Initiatives Game be the opener. It’s in a playable state, at this point i feel we should at least get a reveal trailer.

I love that for some games, I can buy them on one platform and play them on any, usually also with cross-save. Its a huge selling point for me. The only down side is that there are very few games that support xbox play anywhere. All the microsoft exclusives are on there, but I don't buy many microsoft exclusives because I have gamepass ultimate. 

I can see why publishers don't want crossbuy, I mean, I owned 4 copies of gta 5 on different platforms, 2 copies of far cry 4, 3 copies of assassins creed brotherhood, and 3 copies of skyrim.

Are bought expansions/DLC unplayable when a game leaves Game Pass?,"The title says it all. What happens when you have bought DLC or a expansion of a Game Pass game and the base game leaves Game Pass? Are you stranded with unplayable DLC? That is kinda weird.

If true I also think it's the opposite of what Game Pass really achieves. Worries free I can hop into all these different first and third party games. I know most third party games leave Game Pass eventually. This don't worries me because If I played the game and I liked it I just buy the game. But it does worry me when I want to buy a cosmetic item (DLC) or a Story DLC and I know there is a chance I will ""lose"" the option to enjoy this content if I don't spend money on buying the game when its leaving Game Pass.

So anyone got experience in this? What are you thoughts and is this going to be a bigger problem when more games utilize DLCs.",XboxSeriesX,7,0.63

When I moved from X1 to PS4 years ago, I gave both the console and my account to my daughter.  During that time my daughter has purchased her own games and has an extensive list of friends.

Xbox has done a complete 180 since the whole Halo Infinite fiasco.,"When the gameplay event happened back in July, Xbox didn’t seem like it was in the best place and I think we can all agree with that. No major 1st party launch titles except for Halo Infinite and that game looked very unfinished. No forza, no gears, nothing. It got to the point where, after the Halo Infinite delay, I even considered not preordering the Series X and just waiting a year or so.

But wow they turned it around big time. Phil Spencer style. 

Announcement after announcement. Reveal after reveal. Amazing PR lately. They released MFS, announced game streaming was going public with GPU, announced the very affordable Series S, Xbox all access, game pass additions, Game Pass X EA Play, and who could forget, the purchase of Bethesda!

I’m sure I’m forgetting some other stuff too but they have really made a complete turn around from where they were 2-3 months ago. And they’ve been killing it on social media lately too.

XSX or upgrading my PC,"So I currently have a ryzen 2600 with rx 580. I am in a weird spot regarding what path to take. Please discuss

Points favouring upgrading PC:
1.Planning upgrade to a 3060 or AMD equivalent means i will probably have a better GPU than XSX.
2. I already have majority of friends that play on PC not on consoles
3. I already have atleast 150usd worth of games on PC which means i have a small library that I can't bring with me to XSX

Points against upgrading
1. I might only be able to afford a 1080p 144hz monitor which I do not want. 
2. I will have to change my PSU aswell (It's a MasterWatt Lite don't laugh 😭) which adds further cost.
3. I would prefer a 4k TV like TCL P8 because I could watch Netflix and other 4k content on it while being able to play XSX
4. XSX is more portable than lugging around a cpu case
5. Now the most important point. I am entering the phase of my life where I do not think I will have enough time to do upgrades and the usual PC troubleshooting (Even though I am tech savvy enough to do it) I will be an actual registered doctor in 3 months and the 32 hour shifts that come with it are no joke. I would want just a plug and play device which doesn't give me a hassle after a long day at work. I will also ofcourse keep XSX for a few years and might get married and have children in the next 3-4 years which might mean even less time for upgrading and troubleshooting.

Purchasing Games on the Series X..,"OK, so I'm just a little confused here.

This question is mainly related to Cyberpunk 2077, as it will be my first game on the Series X, so I'd like to be fully aware of how it will work when the time comes.

Do i have to buy it on the Xbox One store, and then it would appear on my Series X install page? Or can i buy the same version of the game on the Series X store, and just directly install it there.

I only ask, because I don't want to, say, buy it on the Xbox One, and it only be playable on the Xbox One. Or similarly, I don't want to go to buy it on the Series X, and it by the Series X version that doesn't release for another year or two.

The difference between this launch and previous ones,"Do you remember the xbox one launch?  Aside from the kinnect only games, there weren't that many that could not be played on the xbox 360.  Forza, assassins creed Black flag, call of doodie ghosts, lego marvel superheroes.  I think, of all of these games, the only ones that were next gen only were dead rising 3 and ryse, and I wonder if these games **really** couldnt have played on the xbox 360 too.

This gen there is alot of focus on **true** next gen titles.  With Xbox setting the way and saying everything will be playable on XB1 the initial reaction was ""XB1 will hold games back"" but, now that Sony have decided to cash in too, this is no longer a problem.  Curious huh!  But anyways, I digress.

I've been looking at the titles and this time the only next gen title is the medium, which is fine.  But I wonder why it is such an issue for so many people.

In reality every game over the next couple of years will have had some sort of development on the XB1 (Or in GTAVs case, the XB 360).  Which means the majority of games could have worked on the XB1.  So why shouldn't they?

I appreciate some people want that next generation feel but here I am thinking all of these games will look better on the next gen consoles and, if you haven't played a game, what's the problem with a next gen update?  They could just have held off the release of these games and pegged them as a ""next gen only"" launch titles, but what is the point if it *could* be made to play on multiple generations?

Then I look at titles like gears 5 ultimate, being updated for next gen.  Ironic that if it were not released last year, and the back compat was removed, people wouldn't be questioning if it were next gen or not.  Personally...I haven't played a load of the games that are being ""enhanced"" for next gen yet due to time, and I cant imagine I'm the only one.  So does that make them ""next gen""?

I guess I'm just poking at the thought that, it doesnt really matter where a game was released first (bright memory for example).  If the game is good then we have plenty to be excited about.  A shit game will always be a shit game - even if it maxes out an RTX 3090 and other top of the range hardware.

And, as a disclaimer, im not buying either console at launch.  I'll prolly get one in 2 years when I've paid off some covid related debts.

Now is the time for Xbox to hit hard and go full steam. Amazon Luna is on paper a huge threat,"Amazon Luna has huge international coverage. The Twitch integration is an advantage.

Their Ubisoft deal is a plus too. They call it Ubisoft channel with their new games available on day one. This implies that their will be other channels. 

Speculation: What if PlayStation makes a deal with Amazon? PSnow is already a streaming service, combined with Amazon Luna offer, it can become a stiff competitor to xCloud. 

Amazon Luna has just been announced. We still haven't seen it in action yet. Therefore, if Xbox keeps building on its momentum, keeps pushing games out and if, this is something their are lacking doing, they start to do more TV commercials and all sorts of adverts, then a comfortable advance can be built.

They aren’t looking to do Sony a favour after spending $7.5b on the Bethesda acquisition.

"One account, multiple consoles","Hey,

If I own a Series S and a Series X, am I able to log into both with one account?

I searched around online and found info about game sharing etc (for people who have kids and share games to their account/machine).  But I don't want to do that, just me, one account at the same address so the same wifi network/ip etc. I'm not account sharing or anything weird.

Just trying to figure out if I can, say log into my series S in the bedroom and access everything I own from there. (or at least things the S can access, such as the digital games i own).

I assume though, if say someone was watching Netflix downstairs the system would log them out if I logged into the series S upstairs.  Not a big issue as I doubt i'd ever need both consoles logged in at the same time anyway, but just struggled to find much info for people who want multiple machines but not for sharing games with other users/accounts.

Think i've just been spoiled by Netflix in that I can watch part of an episode on my PC and then continue watching from where I left off on my TV etc.  I just really like that freedom, so it would be nice for my console to do the same.

Again, not a huge issue. But I was just curious but struggled to find info that wasn't all about  parents/kids to share games.  I just want to be able to log into whatever console I want and access my full account.

I'm pretty sure i will be able to but just wasn't quite sure what dodgy restrictions they might have in place.  Nintendo, for example, are massively annoying in that consoles are tied to accounts for the most part.

2. I understand that I should buy a few years (up to three) of Xbox gold and upgrade to Gamepass for $1 because it's a great deal, but this is sort of a loophole.

Do we know wether Xcloud will support gyro aiming?,"So one of the big reasons why I planned on getting a PS5 before getting an Xbox is that the Dualsense has a motion sensor that allows for gyro aiming in shooters.

It's something I've grown very accustomed to when playing on Nintendo Switch and at this point I don't think I can go back to standard stick aiming and having to rely on aim assist.

But now it seems like a lot of shooters like Doom, Wolfenstein and Prey are becoming Xbox first party titles. Unfortunately even the new Xbox controller still seems to not have any motion sensors. But I just remembered that you will be able to play Xbox games on your phone via Xcloud. Gyro aiming is also quite popular on phones and frankly I have no idea how you would even play a shooter on your phone without gyro.

So does that mean that you can use a controller that supports gyro and use it to play Xbox games via xcloud on your phone?

Xbox Series X/S Post Pre-order Megathread,"Hey r/XboxSeriesX

It's been a crazy 48 hours since the Xbox Series X and S went on sale. Many victorious stories of people spamming the F5 key fast enough to get through and unfortunately sad stories of others being beaten by the dreaded web page error demon. Whichever way you look at it, emotions were all over the place.

We have been noticing a lot of posts coming up of people celebrating their pre-orders, noticing their pre-orders being cancelled, and others noticing some sites still having stock and wanting to share. So we figured it would be best to have a megathread for everyone to share all this information in one place. So any of these posts made outside of the megathread will be removed, it all must be put in here.

We would love to try and update this posts with links to sites, but with how quick they sell out we just wouldn't be fast enough so we'll be keeping the sorting by new as the default so people will hopefully be able to catch those type of posts. For those having their pre-orders cancelled, be sure to share it here and any solutions that you might have to help others so that they don't fall victim to it too if its possible to avoid happening. If the solutions are verified to work, I will update this megathread showing the solutions.

As always, if you guys have any suggestions on something to add to this megathread be sure to let us know in modmail.

I am about to cancel my pre-order of an Xbox Series S,"For the first time in my life, I took the decision to pre-order a console, without knowing if it was the right decision. As a broken student, budget is quite short and the Series S appeared as the best pick for me. No 4K TV at home, just a regular cheap Full HD / 60 HZ monitor (plus the fact that I am living abroad for the year so I don't have any monitor in my flat share -&gt; planning on playing games through console streaming) 

Yet, days are passing and the more I think of it, the more it sounds like an impulsive decision, made because of a lack of money. I already have an Xbox One SAD. And while Game Pass is a fantastic feature, even more nowadays, I can't ignore muddy graphics, poor framerate and technical limitations. Deep down, I want to experience true next-gen, I want to see what technology can offer at its best, I want to be amazed and captivated. 

£250 is quite an amount for me so I have to make the right decision. Should I maintain my pre-order, sticking at good ol' 1080p for a decent price ? Or is 4K gaming a genuine game changer that justify such a huge investment in a Series X ?",XboxSeriesX,46,0.37

Who Here Is Getting The Series X A Year Or Six Months Later From Launch?,"IMO, I feel that the Series X is a console with great value and the recent MS acquisition of Bethesda has made me desire the Series X a lot more. However, I won't be getting it at launch and instead around the holidays next year. I feel that the main big reason is that the Series X is seeming like a console that will start to gain value later on in the console generation. Although upcoming games like Avowed, Hellblade 2, and the Bethesda acquisition (with the prospect of future Bethesda titles like Starfield and Fallout 5 being exclusive) has made me want the Series X, most of these games are probably coming out Q4 2021 at the earliest and the effects of the Bethesda acquisition will probably not be so relevant in the first two years of the generation. Because of this, the Series X **at launch** does not seem very appealing, but I think that it will possibly become the best value console when the main Xbox exclusives really start showing up midway in the generation. Although Gamepass undoubtedly has great value, it isn't appealing to me since I'm the sort of person who likes having games physically and also since I already own most games on Gamepass that appeal to me now. As of now, the Series X launch lineup looks less appealing than the PS5 one which has games that appeal to me like Spider-man and Demon's Souls (so I'll be getting the PS5 first since it offers better value to me now), but the Series X (with all the new studios and IP's Xbox has acquired, plus Phil Spencer at the helm) seems to be shaping up as the sleeping giant of the next-gen console generation thats poised to bring the best value and most likely some of the best games.

"Are there any versions of games that will only have the xb1 version? As in, no smart delivery?","After talking with my wife, we have decided that the XB approach to cross-gen games seems better in the sense there is only 1 disc to buy for the xb1's and the series. So we are going to use our XBSX for all the cross gen stuff, and the ps5 for the sony exclusives and online stuff.

My question is, are they ALL like this for now? Or are some going to be just xb1 versions and others will be only for series games? 

I ask because I'm looking into preordering AC Valhalla as something to play on the XB when it launches. Most places like gamestop, bby, target, etc, all seem to show a cover with the smart delivery logo on them, and say Xbox 1 / Xbox Series, leading me to think I could just get that 1 disk, and it would play at varying levels depending on if it was in the xb1, xb1x, or the series x.

XSX with PC,"Will games optimized for XSX run better than a “high end” PC?

Towards the end of last generation, with the release of Destiny 2 on PC, I decided to build my own rig, 1080ti 8700k, runs games great with high frame rates (120 FPS at 1440p) and a high FOV.

I have been an Xbox gamer since the dawn of halo, but now I am questioning this upcoming generation. I have an X1X in home and have a XSX preordered currently.

Everyone says I don’t need an Xbox because everything I can get on PC. Problem is, Gamepass ultimate divides games between PC and console (like Doom Eternal coming up or how Red Dead Redemption 2 was only on Xbox Gamepass). They also enhance certain games for the X1X and will do so for XSX.

So should I keep the XSX preorder and sell my X1X? Sell both? Just want another perspective on maximizing value here going forward.

PSA - You can get up to 3 years of gamepass ultimate for cheap,"With the new Series S/X coming out I'm not sure how many people already have game pass and I figured I'd share this little tip. But to start off this wont work if you already have gamepass ultimate and its only a $1 upgrade if you haven't already used the $1 trial.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently with Microsoft you can upgrade xbox live gold (up to 36 months) to gamepass ultimate for as little as $1. To do this you have to purchase 12 month xbox live gold cards from a retailer, I used Costco as it was $10/card cheaper. Once you have them add them to your account, once all your xbox live gold cards are added visit [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join) and sign up for the 1$ ultimate trial and your done! This automatically converts all your xbox live gold time into gamepass ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to note is as you are adding the xbox live gold cards to your account it will offer you free trials or bonus's for subscribing and such, decline them all. If you are already subscribed to gamepass ultimate instead of a 1:1 transfer, you will only get 1 month of ultimate for every 4 months from an xbox live gold card (so 12 months of gold only gives you 4 months of ultimate). However if your xbox ultimate subscription is a month to month you can simply cancel it and this will still work like normal ;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: just to add this still works even if you've already used the gamepass $1 promo, as long as you dont have an active gamepass sub you can upgrade xbox live gold 1:1 but you will be charged for 1 month of gamepass instead of $1 (for me that was $16 cad).

* Volume/On-Off for TVs that don't support HDMI-CEC
* Series S **only** - option to play disc based games and movies (very few games are disc only, such as ""LEGO Dimensions"", so keep that in mind if you're playing these).

Phil Spencer - the best thing to happen to Xbox since Halo,"Just a few weeks ago, people were calling for his job. Phil Spencer has shifted focus not only for Xbox, but Microsoft, and has put in place a plan for the next 5-8 years. 

When he took over for the disgraced Don Mattrick, Xbox was in shambles. They knew they had to get rid of Kinect, and in the process take away their whole plan for the past years. They took the in-game tumor that was Kinect and erased it. They worked on things like Xbox back compatibility and made it a reality. They didn't completely buy in the doomed VR phases of the game industry. They shied away from spending money on ""exclusive content"" as that would bring more trouble.

What they did do is acquire and put some love into several more studios, create the best value in gaming in Game Pass, and create good will with their consumer base who just wanted great games on a great ecosystem/platform. The future is bright because of Phil, and while he did axe projects because they were dead in the water he also made Crackdown 3 happen, which is a game I really enjoyed almost as much as the first. He also has put money and his own stature at Microsoft on the bet of a better Xbox. The one many of us are trying to preorder with no luck.

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it.

Who here is refugee from geforce now?,"After using gfn for nearly 3 years and having virtually all of my favourite games removed from the service - I am coming to ps5 so I have more actual ownership of my games. Gfn is a great service don't get me wrong and has given me access to a lot of my old steam games (having no suitable pc) but after having virtually all my fighting games removed along with all my racing games, enough is enough. Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5. Finally I will be able to buy a game, knowing it won't be removed, play it without lag, and enjoy 4k.

If they revived an old favorite via sequel or remake for the new generation of consoles what would titles would get you genuinely excited?,"I absolutely love video games and although I would never really call myself a hard-core gamer, especially after having kids and very little time to devote to the hobby, I’ve been around long enough to have my fair share of memorable video game moments.  

The soul crushing experience of beating Ghouls &amp; Ghosts only to find it demanding a second play through to officially beat the game...  Neighborhood friends leaning on my windowsill, mouth agape when we discovered the blood code for Mortal Kombat. My little brother and I picking our jaws up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minutes of Devil May Cry on our PS2 on Christmas morning having never experienced graphics like that on a console before. The two of us huddled under our covers absolutely terrified during a 2 AM session of resident evil or silent hill.

As I mentioned before, now that I’m a dad and don’t have nearly as much time to devote to playing video games as I would like. That said, as I look back, there are a few titles that I would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of consoles. 

**SSX Tricky**- The original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capabilities of that generation of consoles however SSX Tricky brought the beautiful graphics head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physics while adding its own unique brand of humor, customization, and addictive leveling system, all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combinations not seen since the days of Tony Hawk Pro skater. 

To see this title brought to the next generation of consoles with a graphical overhaul, and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new PS5 controllers. Imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo... there’s just so much potential hear it makes me a little crazy. 

**Oddworld: Strangers Wrath** - I can’t honestly remember how I stumbled across this game but it was one that I feel didn’t quite get the praise in attention it deserved. I could be wrong about this, perhaps that was just my perception, but I was left so satisfied after playing through this title. How seamlessly they were able to blend third person  3D platformer and first person shooter was just incredible. And the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volumes. The humor laced throughout, the creativity of “live ammunition“, and with a fantastic storyline to boot, this is one of those titles that genuinely left me sad upon completion as I just simply didn’t want it to end.

**Tiger Woods circa early-mid 2000s** - Damn was this title addictive. I know they are still pumping out titles but they are just not the same. No it wasn’t a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that’s what made it great. The injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation, incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanics, silly customizations, and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from David Feherdy &amp; Gary McCord made these titles so much damn fun. Nothing since has quite been able to capture the magic this series once had. They need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigans. Bring this series back to its glory days! Hell you didn’t even have to like golf to enjoy those games. 

Wipeout - I mean come on this game is PlayStation. Nough said.

New studio acquisitions,"With Microsoft's 7.5 BILLION dollar purchase of Zenimax/Bethesda, I have seen a lot of articles and podcast talking about what studios Sony can buy in response. When I think about it, I would hope that if Sony has money stashed away for these type of acquisitions it would be better spent on creating new studios.
First off, a new studio would cost significantly less than buying established IP. Some of them are outlandish propositions people were putting out would have Sony buying Square Enix (valued around 6.8 billion) and even ubisoft (valued at 10.5 billion). Even if you consider a more realistic acquisition like From Soft(which is tied up under a much larger parent company) or Platinum, you are still talking about very expensive deals.
You could build new mid-sized (70 people) studios for approximately $25 - 35 million (salary + overhead) for the three to four years they would need to start self sustaining with revenue.
What if they started four of them!
They would come with the benefit of creating even more diversity that we would get to play.
I would be far less excited for them to buy an existing studio that already was planning on putting their games on PlayStation.
Just my two cents, but when I thought about that 7.5 billion dollar number, I immediately started thinking about how many new studios Microsoft could have created instead.",PS5,73,0.23

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is.

Playstation Plus November 2020,"I know we haven’t even seen PS+ games for October yet, but I think I had a good idea for one of November’s free games... Resogun

We kicked off the PS4 era with this insanely fun indie, why not pay homage to that, at the start of this new generation? A lot of people may have enter the Playstation family late, in this current gen, and thus might have missed this genuinely little fun side-scroll shooter.

Just a thought. Any other ideas?",PS5,18,0.22
"I'm very sentimental towards my PSN account, but is it really worth keeping for when PS5 comes out?","Sounds an odd question, why not just keep it? Well to be honest I've been tempted for a long time to start fresh and I think this would be a good time to do so. My current account is loaded with way too many friends on my list that I no longer play with, I can get myself a new PSN name for free (already changed it once and didn't like what I chose)

I used to care about Trophies but I haven't bothered due to lack of time to play the game now, that was a main reason I was wanting to keep it around. That said I'm assuming everything restarts fresh with new Trophies etc when PS5 comes out? 

I don't know if anyone else is considering this and maybe your someone who isn't bothered with keeping an account that's over 10 years old, but for me it's a tough decision but I think I might just start fresh. 

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Or know of any reasons why I should keep it?",PS5,51,0.32

Disappointing UK/PAL Box Art News: PS5 to KEEP the PS4 plain white text spine art for Sony games,"When we got box art for Miles Morales in PAL territories, we saw that it had a logo on the side, something that almost never happens for Sony first party pal games... Apart from Spiderman. It led many of us to hope that this would carry over to all next gen first party titles. We had also theorised that perhaps it was just for Spiderman so it would look similar to the first game's, as it appeared to be replicating the box art too.

Unfortunately, that is not the case (pun not intended). The box art for Sackboy has been revealed, and it has the cursed plain white text on it's spine

If you are wondering the meaning of this, [I made a more detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/) about this back when we got that news, complete with pics for non-PAL readers

But I'll give you a brief summary

* If you buy a PAL First party sony game, you get a generic white/black text on the spine of the box. This alone wouldn't be a problem, as the PS2 in Europe had it, and it's quite aesthetically pleasing. The problem is that it is ONLY Sony games with this, instead of everyone like for the PS2. This leaves your collection on your shelf looking like a collection of games, and pirated movies you bought in a foreign country on your vacation.

I was personally holding out hope for some change this generation, but it looks like I am going o have to look into the custom covers/slipcover community to fix this unfortunate reality

This is especially disappointing, as Sony promised a more global approach this generation, but this notion seems to have been just PR speak.

FAQs

&gt;I like the plain text on the PS2!

As do I, but it needs to be all or nothing. All logos, or all plain, it makes some look like lazy knock offs if they're alone

&gt;Why do you care so much?

As a physical owner, I like being able to look on a shelf and seeing the game's I've sunk many hours into. 99.99% of the time, I will finish a game, and then it will sit on the shelf. Is it that wrong to care for how a display piece looks?

&gt;Just use the alternate cover!

I would... if we got those. Most PAL territories get health warnings on the inside cover instead of the reversible covers found on Spiderman and God of War

&gt;Just Print out the US one!

Also not an option, as Sony doesn't put these scans up for Piracy reasons, meaning that if you get one it's a user's own scan, which are far from a good quality. Or you have to import an empty case, which starts to stack up as a costly endeavour if you're replacing a dozen first party games

&gt;First World problem much?

You're right, but Gaming is a first world pastime. If I am spending as much as I am on a game, it's not unreasonable to have packaging that looks good.

&gt;OCD?

No, just have a shelf, like that shelf, want to have some consistency in the games on that shelf",PS5,9,0.46

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",PS5,276,0.82
What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",PS5,158,0.85
Sony should make PS5 UI like their phone UI. Customizable home screen and app drawer.,"PS4's current UI is a disaster, especially if you have a lot of games.  They should adopt a ui similar to phones, with customizable home screen, an easily accessible app drawer, and a home and multitasking button.  The current UI tries to reinvent the wheel and makes things overly complicated.",PS5,10,0.3
What Is do you think biggest advancement from ps4 to ps5 out of all of these?,"We got ray tracing 

We got a Much better cpu 

We got a ssd 

Dual sense (controllers) 

Better graphics (1.8 ps4, ps5 10) 

Better memory usage

3D audio (tempest)

Cooling (it is said the ps5 will be a lot quieter) 


So which of them do you think is the biggest or most exciting advancement? If I missed  something please tell me.",PS5,32,0.42
PS5 should have an option to clean the heatsink/fan without tampering warranty,"As we all know ps4 was a culprit of fan sound due to dust settling on the fan fins and the heatsink, Sony should  think of the option to clean the fans/heatsinks without tampering with the warranty

I want to see people open up their PS5,"I'm curious to see the internal differences between the digital and the disc versions. I opened up my PS4 last week and the disc unit is massive and now I'm wondering what implications/benefits its absence could bring to a console. Smaller, more efficient or quieter fan, smaller power unit, ease to clean up is what I can think of without much effort. They could even leave a spot to add a second SSD, which is very unlikely, but it would be awesome.",PS5,54,0.69

Who else wishes for Sony to have diverse genre of games instead of just story driven third person games?,"As great the story driven games of PS4 are, I wish there were more variety in first party lineup. The games are getting more samey and I am sure I'd eventually get bored of them just like I got bored of Assassins Creed Series and Gears series.

There are no first party multiplayer heavy FPS game, similar to Halo. 

No RPG like BOTW. The only good open world first person RPG Elder Scrolls is supposedly not coming to PS5 and Avowed is the only game that seems to be falling under the same category, which is also again not coming to PS5.

There are no first party arcade racers or cart racers like Forza Horizon or Mario Kart.

 There are no 2D platforming like Ori or Donkey Kong. 

No turn based strategy game like Mario Rabbid or Gears Tactics. 

No game to play and chill with friends, similar to Animals Crossing or Sea Of Thieves.

 No fighting game like Smash Bros or Killer Instinct.

 No RTS like Halo Wars or AoE. 

I might have missed some as well. 

I own every hit PS4 exclusive but I have only played them once. I wish we had more genre of games with more replayability and variety. With new gen of games getting even more expensive, I just wish we had more replayability. I am kind of getting bored of samey looking third person action adventure games.",PS5,37,0.44

How likely is it that GoW Ragnarok will be a ps5 exclusive and not cross gen,"A lot of people on the PlayStation discord think it’s going to be cross-gen but I believe Sony wants to accomplish things not possible on ps4 with the ssd, like between realm fighting, and stuff like that.

Sony Gathering Information About PSVR and Gaming Habits,"I got a lengthy survey from Sony today that took about 10 minutes.
Basically, they were asking me my thoughts on VR, if I owned a PSVR, if I still play it, and why/why not.

They also asked 'What is the most important: gaming on a dedicated device, or being able to play games across multiple devices.'

Very interesting. Could Sony be thinking about opening game streaming to phones like Microsoft is doing? Or perhaps the next PSVR will be open and let you use it with other devices (phones, computers, tablets, etc)?

What are your thoughts?

"Sony's PS5 ""Gamer Feel"" + Wipeout 4, Motorstorm, Knack 3, The Order?","**From** PS1 to PS4, Sony have been there for us as gamers. From the feel-good moments  (""$299!"") &amp; the success taking on the Nintendo 64 &amp; Sega Saturn Juggernauts, Sony started strong.

By the time the PS3 had really hit its stride, with fantastic first party studio acquisitions and partnerships like Naughty Dog, From Software, and Media Molecule, I've always felt that despite owning multiple consoles &amp; PCs, Sony earnt my loyalty.

There have been some tough moments on PS4 (lacking wishlists, playtime, easy internal media storage, and no backwards compatibility through emulation of our PS1/PS2 collections, among others) but we've always been able to count on Sony to treat us like gamers and not insult the value of our time, bringing us first-party experiences like no other, and sharing it with PC &amp; other console brethren when possible. **So thank you Sony**, for bringing up welling excitement with the PS5 like never  before.

**To the point of this post**. There are a few franchises which are difficult to imagine life without, however it feels like too long already. Sony, can you bring us these, in some form or another? Or will they forever languish, lost to competing interests or past memories?

\-**Wipeout Series**. On all Sony consoles, there has been that reliable ultra-fast anti-grav racing experience. The thrill of modern hard electronica thudding through our brains, whilst the blood heats in our veins, has been a fantastic thing to enjoy since the one I began with, Wipeout 2097 (XL for NTSC partiers). It furthered a lifelong love of sensory overload and thumping breaks/d&amp;b. Will it come to PS5? Every month without an announcement is torturous, and surely others feel the same.

\-**Motorstorm Series**. More metal &amp; grunge than anything, and channelling Road Rash, Twisted Metal, and Carmageddon all at the same time, again with the aural overload that brings home the bass. As an Aussie, the locales often dug deep into that need to explore the unknown, and one misses it every day since a very first 720p game on the Fat PS3.

\-**Knack 3**. As someone who likes to look nothing up about games before immersing myself in the world, and after finishing the first knack with a partner, and finally getting around to the second most recently, it was very surprising to learn that the first was moderately well-received, and the second just so slightly more. No other game series, as someone who grew up in the '90s, has been able to put such a feeling of wondrous youth and excitement as an adult. 

**Knack 1 &amp; 2 were** **that** **feeling** of waking up at 5 am, sneaking into the TV room with a blanket, and watching Saturday morning cartoons - but this time, as an adult, with a significant other! That feeling is priceless, in a world where many have lost their ""wonder &amp; magic"" feelings to the prey of a quick, endlessly unsatisfying slot machine-type loop. 

\-**The Order: 1886**. This was a wonderfully cerebral take on the most detailed steampunk city that I've witnessed. The story was gripping, the combat was thrilling, and of course, there was no sequel or mention, after the mediocre reviews ripped it apart for being ""boring, unambitious, not next-gen, a glorified walking simulator"". I am sad to think that this franchise isn't given wings (or perhaps the figurative wings it has been given are the wrong ones?).

\-**PT.** Please. Make it so. The masses have spoken.

So, In conclusion to this essay-length feature, for anyone that made it this far, is a request to SIE to keep valuing our intelligence, and especially those of us that don't have the money but spend it anyway, because we continue to trust in your expertise as gamers and successful innovators.

And to developers that work with Sony: keep producing wonderful works. Resist the temptation to fall prey to companies who have a history of buying and running talented studios into the ground. Push back when the execs tell you that it's not a winning proposition, despite the rich history and worlds you've built. Don't take the easy monetization route, or one that compromises your ability to reach us Single-player experience-based gamers, because in this day and age, when some of us desperately need another world to be transported away to, we don't want to worry whether that world will be there for us in the future.

Tempest and 360 reality audio,"I’m looking for a headset to replace my BT JBL headset that I use for PS4 wired and on my many other devices. 

I have my eye on the Sony WH1000xm4/b

https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4

They list 360 reality audio on a chipset and the PS has the tempest engine chipset so I was wondering how compatible would it/could it be?

Based on PS5 wireless chipset they support BT 5.1 and ideally will support BT headsets but I’m ok with wired. 

My long winded question is; would this be a good choice?

I’m not interested in having two headsets hence why i don’t have the gold/platinum ps4 ones.

I’m open to another brand but ideally I’d like to take advantage of the 3D sound for warzone 😝

What kind of game is missing from Sony’s first party lineup of games?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the games Sony has in the oven ready to go over the next few years. They have a really wide variety of incredibly successful franchises and I don’t think there’s a lot of worry about whether the PS5 will struggle to find enough titles that by themselves will sell consoles. But where’s their weakness? What genre is leaving the biggest hole in Sony Studios first party lineup?

There are a few areas I think Sony could stand to invest in. First, is a military shooter. Maybe not first person, but something heavily combat focused with multiplayer potential. I’m sure the Crist thought goes right to SOCOM, as it should. People have been asking for a reboot for a while now and it’s for good reason. SOCOM was a tight, tactical shooter that gave many players their first taste of online multiplayer. It would do well with a reboot and could solidify the PS5 as the complete console package. 

The second area Sony should look into is a bit ambitious. But a 100+ hour open world game like The Witcher or Red Dead or even Assassin’s Creed would be something gamers could find themselves buying a console just to play. What I mean by this is a huge open world game that keeps players invested in the world and experiences long after the main story is complete. Sony has explored open world style games with Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and most recently with Ghost of Tushima. This has extra implication because Xbox has the Bethesda, the undisputed king of making open world epics. 

Finally, Sony needs a sci-fi game. I don’t really know where on the spectrum of sci-s game needs to fall but with Killzone on the shelf collecting dust something needs to take its place. An argument could be made that Horizon meets the sci-fi criteria but I’m looking more in the realm of aliens, space ships, and energy weapons. It’s a hard genre to perfect but when you do it right it has lasting potential in the world of gaming. I think Sony could see this lasting potential turn into a large adoption of consoles.",PS5,65,0.58

Jokes aside, Sony really needs to start working on this. Back when I created my US account Brazil wasn't even an option and then it took them 10 years to finally launch the store here (and with only a few games at first). 

The expensive dollar to reals right now and the overall economy makes it pretty difficult to buy stuff off my US account. I'd love to finally be able to buy stuff on my own currency.

I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?,"So if you all recall, the PS3 and especially PS4 user interfaces were lacking in a lot of features upon the launch of the respective consoles. For example, both consoles got **themes and background customization support** a lot further down the road. (I always found it weird that even though themes were very much a  thing on PS3, they weren't a thing on PS4 at all until I think about a year into the console's life.

PS4, specifically, got the following features and some others that I'm probably forgetting about a number of years after the console launched: **(folders, quick menu support, online/offline appearance, etc.)**

Sony knows that all these features and more are the kinds of things we expect from the start of a generation at this point. Since they're basically ""quid pro quo"" features for any good UI nowadays. But going off of their track record, I am just concerned we'll be missing a lot of these cool features come November 12th. Keep in mind, I have no idea of the complexities of UI development and don't want to undermine the hard work I'm sure they're putting into the UI.

That reasoning is pushing me to lean towards the ps4 pro since its a little bit smaller. Just curious to other peoples thoughts on that.

"I don't like the idea of Sony buying, konami, capcom or square enix, or any other big publisher.","I have a few  opinions that i want to talk about, hope this post doesn't get deleted

I think nurturing studios is the good way, the way sony did so far,  what microsoft did is just throw money at zenimax and that's it. Is funny how Microsoft hasn't even talked about games that much, all of their doing so far is litetally just throwing money with cheap gamepass service and buying a big publisher.

What i want to say with this is, Sony so far has shown more games (let the games do the talking) and a lot of users seems to forget that the most important part of a service or games  is to have good things to go for, i know gamepass has good games but honestly i don't think all worth paying a monthly fee, a lot are praising gamepass, praising microsoft buying zenimax, which in my mind is bad for all of us, on top of this, MS still hasn't showed or proved that their are going to have a good line up so far.
I know you may say ""but they bought several good team developers by buying zenimax"" well that's true, but we still have not seen any in regards of this, no games, no nada yet.

I think Sony still have a very solid games lineup, strong enough to convince anyone to have a ps5, just don't forget that games are what important most of anything else in this business.

Edit:

some more thoughts

I think MS is not competing, they want to take over the market with brute force (aka money)

Something that im questioning my self too

What would avoid MS to buy a lot more third party publishers, like take two or ea, or ubisoft, in lets say 5-7 years?
It will not be fair to us users having MS locking all of the third party gaming publishers for the sake of ""being competitive""

If i had money to spare i would be beting that this is how microsoft is going to compete from now on until they get most of the share of the market and then to fully become a monopoly, if they succeed.

A Case for Remakes.,"I don't know if I am in the minority here, but I am loving this new boom of video game remakes. Sure, it can be seen as lazy to just give an old game a new can of paint and sell it off to us for nostalgia reasons, but I'm actually excited about that.

As a movie buff, I am always interested in remakes, seeing how a different director puts his vision into a known project. I guess the same thing pertains to games. I want to see how my old favorites would look with modern graphics. Plus, with recent remakes, they feel like entirely new games (FF7 remake), despite being the same subject material.

So, are there any old games you'd love to see remade? I'd love to see Dead Space make a return. Although looking at it now, the lighting is ahead of its time by a mile, it would be nice to see it with crazy graphics. And the 3D sound? Mah Gahd.

Unanswered questions regarding the Playstation 5,"I apologize for my bad english.   
This  is not about anwering my ""questions"" but more about the fact that many things are still unknown. All these things can change the opinion on the Playstation 5 drastically. 

The PS5 release date and price are finally public (or atleast for more than a week). Some people were lucky enough and managed to pre-order a Playstation 5 and many people were not. I was lucky enough and managed to grab a launch day PS5 Disk Preorder. Since that day I've been unpatiently counting down the days 'till I can get my hands on that beautiful piece of tech.

And yet there are some questions that are floating in my mind.

**What is the noise level of the Playstation 5?**The Playstation 4 was known for its bad cooling system and loud fans and I'm worried that the PS5 will be the continuation of this story. Sony already announced that they invested a huge amount of money into the development of a good cooling solution but there is always a fine line between marketing babble and facts. I for my part did not own a PS4 (I switched to PC) and can't judge it for myself but I'm still worried.

**Why is sony still so vague about backwards compability?**I know, I know... Sony already announced that many games PS4 games will be playable on the PS5 but I'm still wondering how PS5 digital users will be able to do so. Sony is still really vague and I'm worried that there will be on or another catch. Microsoft really did a good job and made everything quite clear.I'm still hoping that sony will do the same. I really can't wait on getting my hands on all those great PS4 games that I missed out on. (Yes. I will definitely make use of the PS plus collection)

**What will the UI look like?**Up until now we were only able to get a short glimpse at the new Playstation 5 UI. I'm really looking forward on getting more footage of the UI.

**What's with Background Applications like Discord, or Teamspeak?**It wasn't possible with the Playstation 4 but maybe with the 5. I really would like to be able to talk to my PC or Xbox friends while I'm playing on my PS5 without leaving my computer on. This feature would really improve the whole gaming experience.

**Will we ever get a black PS5 oder atleast good Playstation 5 skins?**The opinions on the Playstation 5 design vary quite a lot and range from ""I love it"" to ""It's fcking disgusting"". The design of consoles or rather more everything is always a highly subjective matter but still... Sony made a high risk choice. The Playstation 5 design really stands out and some or not many people would appreciate the ability to get  rid  of the white colour. I am really hoping for a black PS5.Thankfully Dbrand already announced their skin line-up for the Playstation 5.

&amp;#x200B;

Will disk-based PS5 games require a full-copy/install to play?,"Update: This is 100% the case. I didn't realize PS4 already does this so fully expect this to continue. 

Has Sony talked about how they plan to handle disk-based games and game installs? This new PS5 SSD technology doesn't really apply if the system has to try to read the data from the disk, which I'd guess is many factors slower than SSD read speeds. I imagine it wouldn't need to copy over certain things, like menus and other data that doesn't need to be read as quickly. But those make up a small portion of the actual game data.

What I could totally see them doing is: You pop the disk in, and it has to copy over nearly the entire game over to the SSD for gameplay. I REALLY hope this isn't the case. The reason I bought the disk-based console is to mitigate the issue that my HD is constantly full from downloading games/updates. If the console requires copying over disk-based games, that benefit goes out the window. I would still get the benefit that copying from disk is still faster than download speeds if I want to delete and later reinstall the game.

Did anyone feel completely underwhelmed by the COD Alpha?,"It was fun and had Unreal Tournament vibes, but I just feel like the game took several steps back in almost every way.

I hate to say it, but I don't even think some cool Dual Sense additions could even bump this game up higher than a 6 or 7 at the end of the day.

You wake up to a news release indicating that a game from some point in your gaming past - recent or a long time ago - is being remade from the ground up for the PS5. Maybe it's exclusive, maybe not, that's up to you. 

It can be from any console generation; want to remake a beloved Atari 2600 or Magnavox Odyssey game? Awesome. A PS4 favorite? Also awesome.

I know that specs don't matter but PS5 is way closer than people think to the Series X on every level,"1. The CPU conundrum and why many seem to misunderstand it. While *fixed clocked speeds seem inherently better than variable frequencies, they are much harder to cool since the system needs to be ready for a worse case scenario at all times and use up more power needlessly.* There's a reason why every major semiconductor has ditched fixed clock speeds for more than 5 years and it's the reason the PS4 seemed loud as heck (lack of culling) [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/fujtke/purpose_of_variable_frequencies/) thread sums the this point better if interested but that's the basic idea why PS5 went for Smartshift vs going for a fixed frequency.
2. GPU: Same point about the variable clock speeds vs fixed. The biggest difference to me here is the amount of CU's the Series X has for RT performance vs  the PS5 not the Tflops.  80 bil ray/s x 208 RT cores (52 x 4 TMU's per CU's in RDNA2 and each TMU has 1 RT Core in RDNA2) x 1825 mhz divided by the industry standard 10 deep BVH and the result is roughly 38 Giga rays/s , so it will have way better performance on that front. Now the PS5 GPU has more fill rate, internal GPU bandwidth and faster triangle set-up so it's not a knockout just because Youtubers tell u 12 vs 10,2 Tflops.
3. Ram: The biggest problem for the Series X imo. While it's 10 GB's of Vram are **insanely fast** (can't stress that enough) it's simply not enough for some games at 4K, we're seeing that now with the 3080 and just how much lack of Vram can hurt. Problem number 2 is that it's segmented unlike the PS5's unified 16 GB running at 448 GB/s. The Series X also uses half a gig of ram more than the PS5 for the OS but that's nothing crazy.
4. SSD: Short and sweet since this isn't much of a battle. The Series X in theory can do a maximum of 6GB/s compressed which thanks to bottle necks is closer to 3GB/S real life performance. PS5 can go to up to 22 GB/S thanks to the IO coprocessors, crazy SSD and Kraken Decompression unit meaning in real performance that games can load in about 2 -3 seconds flat.

Conclusion: The PS5 was designed to be as easy to develop for as humanely possible (which was clear after the Road to PS5) since it doesn't have any major bottlenecks as a system and while not offering the same beefy performance as the Series X it does make it's power easier to access to devs so I don't think anyone should expect major if any differences on 3rd party multiplats. Hope this helps, but please feel free to disagree and correct me if you disagree with this post",PS5,92,0.44
Backwards comparability work around,"I read today that if you own the Standard PS5 you’ll be able to insert your PS4 disks and they’ll convert to a digital version that will then be playable on your PS5.

What would stop me from purchasing a Standard PS5, converting the few PS4 disks I have to their digital versions using the disk drive, and then retuning the Standard PS5 to the store.

Idea for a new Castlevania game,"This is my own personal opinion on how to make a new one and how to do it right. To be clear, this is a 3D Castlevania game.

- Dark Souls/Bloodborne inspired with a focus on the checkpoint to checkpoint style gameplay
- Game is meant to be difficult but fair *(just like Dark Souls and the Classic Castlevania games)*
- Classic enemies from the old games to come back with their iconic designs but just modernized a bit
- Soundtrack meant to invoke memories of playing the NES and SNES Castlevania games
- Whip is used to attack as well as grab items or even get to areas out of reach of a normal jump
- Bring back the wall meat behind secret breakable walls!
- Classic items like the cross, the throwing axe and holy water to return and with some new functionality to make them useful in a 3D environment 
- Base game features a full and complete story of the main character, Simon Belmont, defeating Dracula
- Each DLC is it’s own story with new locations, enemies, and you play as a new character with unique weapons and items",PS5,24,0.39
Could we see the return of couch co-op with next gen?,"The last two generations it was difficult for consoles to run games with two camera views at a solid FPS and decent resolution. Most Devs priorities lied in just getting the best they could with one camera.

Sony can and should offer PS5 enhanced versions of PS4 games for free like microsoft.,"Microsoft lets you buy a copy of grand theft auto 4 13 years ago and still support it on their next generation hardware. Sony can't even make a enhanced version of spiderman ps4 free to current owners. This is the same BS in my opinion as offering ps3 classics you have to pay for rather than allowing you to get them free if you already own then on the ps3.

I'm just wondering what others in this community think about this.


Edit: ok so GTA IV was a bad example (but a fantastic game, pls be on ps5), basically my point was that CDPR, ubisoft, microsoft and a few others have said that the next generation version, as in the entire updated/enhanced game will be available to current owners for free.
These games are going to be a goodwill to consumers who are early adopters to new platforms and will hopefully be available years into the generation.

Sony is ""remastering"" a 2 year old game rather than providing a substantial update, this is a ploy to get people to buy it twice, they are clearly not trying to bolster sales to people who do not own it because it's only available as a collectors edition on top of the sequel. It's not only locked behind another game like modern warfare remastered, it's also a paid enhanced version that of it was another developer you'd probably get free.",PS5,790,0.72

Expanding Your PS5 Drive Space? Note That NVMe Drives Must Be Whitelisted by Sony,"I’m seeing a lot of chatter after Microsoft released their SSD expansion drive ($220!!!!). That’s honestly a lot of money. However, I’m seeing a lot of response from people saying that thank goodness PS5 will take any NVMe drive which can have prices anywhere from $50 to hundreds of dollars depending on size. 

However, you need to note that Sony must [whitelist the SSD drive](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5)

You can’t use any NVMe drive, so please don’t buy a cheap one you found online thinking it’ll work. I don’t believe anything has been officially whitelisted by Sony yet. There’s one drive that people are assuming might work, which is [this one](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price).

Note that it’s $229 for 1TB. The cost of super fast load times and world loading is expensive. At least for now. *So I just wanted to warn people and inform people to just wait for a bit until we get official confirmation from Sony on which drives will work. And brace yourself on price. Maybe they’ll be $229, maybe they’ll be less, but they definitely won’t be cheap. Don’t buy a NVMe drive until we get confirmation that it’ll work in the system.*

Edit: There’s some discussion of semantics on what “whitelisting” means in this article. It’s beside the point. Sony and Mark Cerny have already stated they will provide a list of compatible drives. If the system may allow drives that Sony doesn’t recommend but still technically work, that’s up to individuals to try. For the vast majority of you, focus on the italicized text above and do not buy anything until Sony provides a list of compatible drives. The system doesn’t take just any NVMe drive and buying some random cheap one off Amazon will not work.",PS5,479,0.95

However, it's important to remember that the team behind FFXVI is a completely different team from those games.

How to improve PS Now?,"While PS Now has more than enough titles to be played, the majority of games have to be streamed. Only certain PS4 and surprisingly PS2 titles can be downloaded. There is no way to emulate PS3 games. Streaming games requires a very strong internet connection, preferably a wired connection or 5ghz wireless. However, the quality of streamed games via PS Now isn't up to the quality compared to other cloud based services (e.g. GeForce Now). How could Sony make the service much more appealing to costumers? Here are some points that i think would greatly enhance the service:

1. **Make PS Now a software based full backwards compatibility solution:**

\- Bring back the game catalog of PS1 classics and expand the games we have on PS Now

\- Make it possible to emulate PS3 games  (maybe the PS5 could do it?) OR improve the streaming quality;

\- PSNow should be the ""game pass"" of older Playstation games

**2. Tie in the Playstation Store**

\- The PS4 can emulate PS2 games; why didnt we get the PS2 games we bought digitally back in the store? -&gt; apply this to PS1 games aswell

\- Games available on PSNow should be able to be bought through the PS Store (apply this for PS4 and PS5 users)

**3. PS Plus**

\- PSNow should be included in PS Plus OR in a PS Plus Premium subscription

\- Give away one month of PSNow (or PS Plus) whenever someone buys accessoires for their consoles (like controllers)

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to see PS Now as a software solution to the missing full backwards compatibility we have on the PS5. Bring back PS1 and PS2 games into the PS Store, because there really is no reason to keep those games away from the store, when we can already see that the PS4 console can emulate PS2 games through PSNow. Also, if it can emulate PS2 games, it should also be able to emulate PS1 games easily. I admit PS3 games are tricky, and if the PS5 is not able to emulate PS3 games, then Sony should improve their cloud based gaming.

**TL;DR:** Bring back PS1/PS2 games to the store, add those games into PSNow, improve cloud based gaming for PS3 games, include the service in PS Plus or in a new ""Premium"" PS Plus subscription",PS5,79,0.75

Appreciation of future proofing,"With 49 days left to go I wanted to draw some attention to some of the benefits of an upgrade that aren’t necessarily game related. The quality of life stuff that as a launch PS4 owner are the biggest reasons I’m super amped for the next generation. Those being the NVME expandable storage, WiFi 6, and HDMI 2.1. All of those are yet to be ubiquitous, and while we may have a slightly weaker console it’s amazing that they packed years worth of upgrades in for the same cost as a competitor. 

WiFi 6 is still potentially limited for some things on PlayStation’s end, but with game streaming and digital downloads becoming more and more prevalent and gigabit internet becoming more common it’s awesome that we may see much higher throughput. 

NVME upgradeable internal storage is a HUGE win. Not being locked to a certain size or company could benefit us immensely in terms of cost in the long run. 

HDMI 2.1 is already here, though not super affordable yet. While I don’t see these consoles ever hitting 8K with some insane DLSS style magic 4K 120 already feels like a great late gen target for especially first party titles. 

Let me know if I’m out of line or missed something!

I agree that the £10 increase worldwide is likely due to catching up with inflation, but I think the pricing on top of that is simply the higher prices that launch titles typically sell for. I'd expect games to average around £55-60 in the future",PS5,145,0.53

I really don't like the location of Spider-Man: Miles Morales. so listen to me rant about it,"Not going to lie, kind of got mad when I heard in the trailer, ""This is the best part of living in Harlem."" Yea I know Harlem is cool and I know that's where he lives in the Spider-Man for PS4 game, but the map is going to be an exact copy of the PS4 map. Unless you can go farther north of Manhattan I don't really want to just play a copy of Spider-Man for PS4 if the only difference is the story and characters.

In my humble opinion I think it should've taken place is Brooklyn, and here's why

1. Miles lives in Brooklyn. In the original comics, most tv show's he's been referenced in. Heck, even Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
2. Brooklyn is a completely different map. New places to explore and people can get over playing in Manhattan and move onto Brooklyn. I think it's idiotic that they just copy and pasted the exact same thing. At least move the location
3. Brooklyn is so much better than Manhattan. First, it's skyline is still pretty large and if that's the only reason it's still in Manhattan is because it's skyline is slightly smaller that's like saying L.A. is better because the hills are bigger than San Diego. Second, People who aren't familiar with Brooklyn can get to know at least the basics. I had no idea where things were in Manhattan but Spider-Man for PS4 taught me that. I think we're all ready to move on to Manhattan's younger but cooler sister. And Third, Manhattan is boring to at least me... I can't tell you how many times I've played PS4 Spider-Man but then just got bored of Manhattan. I wished I could go to Brooklyn or even at least to liberty island but no. Just same old Manhattan
4. And finally, Why not? It's not like there's gonna be any problems. One, If it's because Brooklyn is too big, then just cut a few things out. Not all of Brooklyn has to be there. And if it's because Brooklyn has some parts that are mostly residential and filled with one story/two story houses... well
5. Why they shouldn't... There are a ton of parts in Brooklyn where it's just mostly residential houses and not apartments or tall skyscrapers. But of course there are in Manhattan too. Not as much of course but still. I think that is one of the main reasons why they won't stage it in Brooklyn, but I still think Brooklyn would be a lovely place for a Spider-Man to take place in. So get on that

EDIT:

So I've gotten the feedback I wanted and turns out the game wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. People have told me it's more of an expansion pack than a new game in of itself. And it seems some people do agree with me. But in the wrong context

People agree that when actual Spider-Man 2 comes out, then yes it would be amazing to be able to go to Brooklyn and or... Jersey City? Anyway people really didn't agree with me ranting about this game. The game I was ranting about was a game that was just more of an expansion pack than a new game. And yea I didn't know that and yea I probably should've researched it before making a 5-6 paragraph post ranting about it.

In conclusion. I still think that going to Brooklyn in actual Spider-Man 2 would be awesome. But for now I understand why they wouldn't for this game. ",PS5,29,0.26

I understand that the dying a lot is a part of souls games and im fine with that. The big part about me not continuing with bloodborne, is just that I literally had no idea where to go lol. The combat alone couldn’t keep me into the game as I felt like I wasn’t progressing. I just want to know if demon souls has that same type of just leaving you in the world aspect of bloodborne, or if they kinda show you where to go and help guide you in a way, like a linear experience (The gameplay trailer looked like it guided you to the boss) I’m not asking for it to hold my hand the entire way though, I just want to play the game without having to search the internet or use YouTube videos all the time like how people recommend to do with bloodborne.

Are These M Rated Games Appropriate For A 13 Year Old?,"A bit of back round knowledge I am a 13 year old who is a soon to be first time play PlayStation owner.

Like many of you I am really excited for the PlayStation 5. I was one of the lucky few who was able to preorder the PlayStation 5. I plan to use the PlayStation 5 for backwards compatibility for the first one to two years. I already have the Uncharted games, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ratchet and Clank. My problem is that there are four M rated games I want to play, these are God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. I cant play these games legally unless my parents buy the games for me. So what makes these games M rated? My parents would be ok with stuff like bad words and a bit of blood but things like really gory stuff or other stuff I don't know about. So If you can leave a reply about stuff that happens in these games that would be nice and if you need to know more i'll try to answer people.

TL;DR Im 13 and want these M rated games God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. What makes them M rated?

UPDATE

I looked at what many people have said. I think I am going to get Persona 5 and God of War. People said the other to games were a bit much, I will wait to get those games till I am older. People said god of war is a lot of fantasy violence and bad words which is ok. I still kinda think about if my parents will let me play Persona 5 but, Many of you said I had Important themes that could show me good morales. I'll probably ask for these games in Christmas season and thats when my parents will look into this stuff. So thanks for helping me with the good advice!",PS5,370,0.79

"SOCOM Is Sony’s Opportunity to compete against Call of Duty, and they seriously need it","This is probably going to get seriously downvoted, but I think it needs to be said. While Sony has gotten a great reputation for their single-player exclusives, none of their IP can match the behemoth amount of popularity and clout as the Call off Duty series and Fortnite. 

Why does that matter?

Sony has been aggressively making third-Party deals to make PS5 the best place to play those games, whether it be their deals with Activision, Rockstar, timed exclusivity with Bethesda, or exclusive DLC from the Marvel Avengers Game. And while that may help Sony in the short-term, they need their own IP that is as large as a publishers like Square Enix, Rockstar, or Activision. The reason why is because they simply cannot afford to just straight up buy studios like that, at least not as large as those I just mentioned. Sure Sony is building their own reputation with these IP’s, God of War, The Last of Us, and many more, but these IP’s don’t make the same amount of money as COD, Battlefield, FIFA, Fortnite or any battle royale game. They absolutely need at least one IP as big as them because if Microsoft can just throw money at a studio like ZeniMax and own them, it doesn’t matter if those games are put on PS5, if Microsoft felt like it, they could just not put those games on there. We could speculate whether they would or wouldn’t, but that doesn’t matter, the very fact that they COULD isn’t something to take lightly and should be combated.

I think SOCOM has the potential to be as big an IP as Call of Duty, and it needs to be so that way they have at least one game that has a similar wide amount of appeal and monetization that they have more power to sway others to the ecosystem, and more importantly have the cash to rival Microsoft. This is just my opinion, but I do think it’s important that Sony as a whole has the buying power to sway others from getting bought out completely by negotiating third-Party deals, and Sony needs that cash cow where their profits are exceedingly high compared to the cost to produce them. And plus, SOCOM kicked ass, it deserves a comeback, and knowing Sony, it could be a cash cow without being soulless either. And please, I’m not a fanboy, I just don’t want Microsoft to become have a monopoly on gaming.",PS5,59,0.42

Is anyone else shocked by the entitlement?,"This is mostly referring to Spider-Man Remaster, but could apply to future games.

I've been seeing people in lots of threads essentially crapping all over Insomniac and Sony for charging for the remaster of SM. People are stating that the remaster should be free and cite that other games are getting free upgrade paths to PS5.

Now I'm not opposed to games getting free upgrade paths to the PS5. But what is coming with those upgrades? If it's minor work that equates to the flip of the switch that provides better fps, slightly better graphics and even better load times, then yes that should be free. People like to bring up Witcher 3 and the free upgrades its getting, but from what's stated in articles that people cite, it sounds like the witcher is mostly(I know they said something about ray tracing) just getting upscaled graphics,fps bump and load bump.

But a game like SM:remaster isn't just doing that. [Here](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/16/see-the-marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-new-gameplay-demo/) you will see that the remaster isn't a simple upscale job. Insomniac went back to a 2 year old game and completely updated many assets. There will be better hair, facial animations, skin, eyes, the new model for Peter. Also you'll they added ray-traced reflections and ambient shadows, improved lighting, more pedestrians and vehicles stretching further into the distance, and the same optional performance mode offered on Miles Morales. This will  allow you to play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate. The remaster will be supporting near-instant loading, 3D audio, and the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback. They are also  adding three new Spider-Man suits, new photo mode features, and new trophies.


Then people start talking about Cyberpunk giving a free ps5 upgrade down the line as some kind of major counter point. It's not. Cyber Punk has been in development for quite some time, and it's very likely that they knew that the next gen console wasn't far off. This means that time was built in to have these upgrades ready at some point after launch. It's not like SM (2018) that has been completed for two years and is now being reworked for the PS5. I've also heard that because of the fact that it's releasing on PC, the development is concurrent and that makes it easier to develop for the next gen consoles. 


I don't know, it's just shocking to me. It's like if someone is doing someone's backyard and make it look super nice (a new deck, new lawn, some trees, a water feature) they get paid when they complete the job. Now the job is complete and time has passed and you want to update your backyard a bit, update some features to make them look nicer, and in some cases replace certain parts all together, well that takes time and will be paid for as well. It likely won't cost the same as doing the original project, but still changes were made and new things are being added in. 

What do you all think? What should be the criteria for free upgrades and what should be the criteria for a paid upgrade? To me, if you are going back and putting in a lot of new things into an old game, that should be paid. If it's just what amount to performance bumps, graphics quality increases etc, that should be free.

So we'll have this new tech in our hands and no statements as to whether or not it'll last longer. Especially since games these days are much more reliant on the triggers. I remember when shooters used face buttons to fire, and acceleration in racers was X. Now they're fully on the triggers for ADS/FIRE and BRAKE/GAS. Also joining them is action games with the influence of Dark Souls bringing light and heavy attacks to the bumper and trigger respectively. What at one point were just buttons on the front of the controller, are now arguably the most heavily used functions across nearly every genre. I just wish they'd say something along the lines of ""it's more durable.""",PS5,35,0.3

With PES, Sony could have a decent alternative/competitor to Fifa, which honestly has been going down in quality for basically a decade. I know EA has monopoly on licenses, but Sony could do something creative to work around it.

Contra could be remade in 3D and be similar to Doom or even Killzone, or it could stay 2D and be reborn as a rogue-like series.

MGS and Silent Hill... nothing needs to be said. Konami virtually seppuku'd with these two franchises.

"Insomniac is finally first party, it's time to return to the Resistance","Resistance 2 is one of the best realised, and most genuinely enjoyable games I've ever played. 

Single player. The story, the foreboding, the descent into madness. You play as an absolute superhuman, hot on the trail of the leaders and the dark secrets swirling behind the scenes. The final scene of resistance 2 will forever be etched in my mind,

""Can you hear them calling to us? It's beautiful"" + fade to black + gunshot

FULL CO-OP! But this ain't yo mommas co-op. In Resistance you play as a member on one of the teams charged with cleaning up and preparing the way for the main character in the single player game. Skills, progression, immersion, again one of the best co-op experiences that has only been exceeded by monster Hunter in my mind

Multiplayer. No longer are you a god, nor a super soldier, you're now a grunt. The lowest of the low you fight in the constant meat grinder of the frontlines in the ongoing alien invasion. Praying to last long enough for some faceless hero to stem the incessant tides so you can see tomorrow. In this mode you actually step in to the shoes of the chimera, which was mind blowing

Then there were the brilliant guns. The auger, hedgehog, marksman rifle, etc. All the guns felt great, and packed with personality

Unfortunately Resistance 3 threw out basically every thing great about 2 and signaled its untimely demise. Although it is interesting how much it foreshadowed naughty dog's eventual masterpiece, TLOU

-Sony buys FROM software, and gives that sweet funding and support to future souls like titles. 

-Resistance fall of man remake

-60fps Bloodborne

-Square Enix, Kojima productions, capcom, and rockstar stay 3rd party devs.

- I hope demon souls does really well and then bluepoint try to make their own soulslike IP. That gameplay looks soo clean.

- A Sony Studio making a full out RPG akin to Skyrim in open endedness.

- Naughty Dog making a new Linear Story IP with a whole new vibe. Maybe a sci fi, or a detective story, or a war story. 

- Pleeeease let Hogwarts Legacy be good. The franchise desperately needs a good entry. 

- I want the Dune movie to do really well and then get either a linear story or open world game on Arrakis. Im a huge nerd for the books. Crysknife and lasgun combat and survival mechanics when in the desert. Video game worms. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm

- An ancient egypt open world game not part of assassins creed.

- Probably wont happen but I want Portal 1 and 2 remastered and released as 1 game on ps5.

- Remake RDR1 in the RDR2 map (adding in mexico). Make it playable after beating the RDR2 story. It would just make so much sense. Would warrant a replay so hard.

- kojima made silent hill reboot. 

- a good remake of Resident Evil 4

- for atomic heart to be as good as it looks

- for the duelsense battery to last a very long time on a full charge.

- rockband 4 complete edition where it comes with every song (dlc and base game) from all 4 games, plus ps5 compatible instruments. Not a lot of hope for this one lol

- an open world game where you play as a cop, and part of the main story involves discovering corruption within your own police force regarding a crime conspiracy, and then going rogue to stop it.

I don’t think the Sony preorder invites were as random as we thought,"I don’t think the Sony invites were as random as we thought, and here’s why

First off, I am not an expert on marketing in any way shape or form, but I do think I see why some people got the Sony invite and others didn’t. 

Let’s first look at how you signed up for a chance to get an invite. We were all able to send in our PSN name to be placed on an email list of the possibility to get a pre-order invite. Sony, being a big tech company, has more than enough resources to create a computer system to filter through all those who put their PSN name in their data base. They can look at how often you play, how often you buy digital games, how long you’ve owned a PlayStation product, etc. 

Now let’s look at those who did and didn’t get an invite. This is all based on the megathread comments and not any real information. From reading the comments, there was many complaints about how people didn’t get their invite for a preorder, even though they spend hours and hours playing games, spending tons of money on buying digital games, having every single PlayStation console, and having x amount platinum trophies. You’re what you call a hardcore PlayStation player. And another complaint I would hear from the hardcore PlayStation players was that a lot of their friends who got the invite hardly play as often as they do. Or they barely got their PS4 a few months ago. How did they get an invite and I didn’t? Here what I think is why

I believe those who aren’t hardcore PlayStation players are casual players. And Sony wanted to cater towards those casual players to get them to buy their product. More than likely, those of you who are considered casual gamers would buy a system eventually, either when it comes out, or later on during its life cycle. Or even if you do plan on buying a console, it’s possible you were already on the fence about which console to buy. I mean, let’s face it, Xbox has one heck of a deal with their monthly plan being available. They wanted to sway the casual gamer towards the PlayStation by sending them a very special invite that basically guarantees them a preorder. But why not the hardcore PlayStation fan? Because they figure hardcore gamers are more than likely going to buy a PS5 regardless if they get an invite or not. Now those of you who didn’t get an invite, ask yourself, are you still looking for a PS5 everyday? And if you can’t find one today, will you look tomorrow? And if you answered yes to these questions, Sony has you where they want you. 

Let’s look at how they marketed the PS5 as well. First off they created two different, but the same systems. A digital and a disk version. These were not revealed for the longest time and neither were their prices and release dates. When it comes to their prices and release date for preorders, they wanted to create a mock supply and demand by placing the preorders out of the blue soon after their event. I think this was by design more than we think. Yes, I do also think it was to keep away scalpers. Which was smart. But it also created a panic of, “Oh no! I have to get one now! Where can I find it?! They’re all sold out of preorders!” And that’s when they started to send out the invites. After the initial frenzy that occurred. It’s like they were playing mental games amongst its users by saying all no it’s all gone, but you are a special one and you’ll get an invite. 

This all might just be bogus, but this is why I think the Sony invites were not as random as we thought. What do you all think?

EDIT: This is all speculation. There is no conclusive evidence to this at all. It was just a thought that I had. Accessibility is huge with marketing. If you can’t access it, then you can’t buy it. If you’re a casual player and don’t have access to an immediate preorder, you’re less likely going to seek a preorder out. And to change up a little to what I had to say, “Casual players were more likely to get an invite than hardcore players”",PS5,21,0.3

Digital versions of the PS5 may only make up 15-20% of the available stock.

This is on top of the fact that the $100 lower cost means that the demand for the digital edition seems to be pretty high. 

I’m guessing that Sony knows that, initially, people will probably be willing to pay more to be one of the first people to get them. 

Also, if they think they can rapidly sell pretty much all the units they can manufacture, it is only logical to have the factory churning out the more expensive version at first.

If there is one thing Sony can learn from bethesda acquisition is that timed exclusives are not the way forward,"Lately Sony has been pushing timed exclusives really hard.  **Bugsnax, Deathloop, GhostWire: Tokyo, Godfall, Kena Bridge of spirits,  Oddworld: Soulstorm** these are all timed exclusives. 

In some cases timed exclusives are good. Where you give a small developer the budget to develop their games and in return you get it as a timed exclusive like in the case of Nier Automata. but in most other cases, its a No no.

Not only will these games come to other consoles, it feels wasted potential. Rather than getting timed exclusivity deal on so many games, Sony should acquire or develop a new studio. At least by doing so you get to own the IP, the talent and the pedigree.  A single proper high budget exclusive like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon Zero Dawn does more for the console prestige than 4-5 timed exclusives. These games become ambassadors of the console, while the timed exclusive part is forgotten. Now I am not saying that Sony should go and buy a big publisher, but they should be on the look out for studios with potential, like they did with insomniac.",PS5,128,0.43

* Is there still remote play?

New IP vs Sequel/Remake,"I personally am not a fan of remakes and to an extent sequels (but not as much). I've already played the game, why do I need to play it again? 

Just been hearing this a lot recently ""So and so should totally remake 'this game'!"" or ""I loved 'this game' they should really make a sequel!"" 

Hear me out. I would so much rather a team work on something totaly new than spend their time remaking an old game. 

I'm not against sequels if they fit but a sequel just for sequels sake not a fan of that.(I have been pleasantly surprised by some)

For example. 

If Sucker Punch just made an Infamous sequel we'd never have gotten Ghost of Tsushima.

I think there are a lot of misconceptions about the difference between PS4 back compat games vs next gen patches vs remasters,"Folks say, well you can just play 2018 Spiderman on the PS5 why pay extra for the ultimate edition of Miles Morales?

In my mind, a remaster will likely include all new textures, possibly run in the engine from MM rather than the older version used in 2018. 

Not to mention possibly adding content or using more features of the PS5 than just “it loads faster”. 

I understand a lot of company’s are doing patches to make their older games run better but my bet is that they are not full remasters for the new system taking advantage of haptic feedback, Improved AI possibilities etc. Most likely these “upgraded” games will run at a higher frame rate, add in RT or just load much faster.

In all, I think paying $20 for a remastered version of 2018 Spiderman will probably be worth it as long as it takes some of the new features of the PS5 and implements then.",PS5,45,0.67

First person shooters, first person role playing games, and whatever Sea of Thieves pique my interest. The thing is, I’m a one console guy. I know I’m a Sony fanboy and if I get a second console it’s Nintendo. What I also know is that these types of scenarios can bring the best out of competitors.

Imagine what PlayStation could do with proper backing.,"Like we all know that the only reason Xbox has stuck around for so long is that MS could keep throwing money at it, the reason Gamepass is there is because MS can just keep on eating the losses.

Sometimes I wonder what PS could do if they had similar backing to what Xbox has. I feel like if PS did have proper backing there would be a PS version of Gamepass and what not. Xbox also has the benefit of having huge teams of people to draw from other MS services.

I hope that PS does somehow create a gamepass thing because it would be great, I understand the high prices of games but I would like a Netflix but for gaming or atleast something like Disney+ for Sony first-party games.

Sony really do need to respond to the Zenimax acquisition, I know that it doesn't ""threaten"" them as such, they still have more must have games than anyone else and will always sell hardware because of that, but it does basically single handedly put Microsoft back in the race and threatens further acquisition down the road.

Everyone suggests names like Capcom, Konami, Square Enix and FROM. Are any of these feasible? Personally I think Take 2 is simple too expensive.

Of all of those I feel Capcom would be main source of quality, must have games.

Physical game copies,"I think we can all agree on the excitement of the ps5 and all of the upcoming games, but before any information was released about the console or games way back last year, I was pretty confident that games were going to move from disks to more of a memory card esk type deal (think XSX expandable storage but for games instead)
It was a given the console was going to have a disk drive as it's also considered an entertainment centre for most so removing the disk drive would have been a terrible move.
But with the new console focusing more on load times this gen, I was sort of expecting a new kind of physical copy for games.
I know disks nowadays can hold a massive amount of information compared to say 10 years ago but has the read/write speed increased with this also?

Why is everyone assuming that retailers will start selling the PS5 without notice again?,"For the past few days, I have been seeing posts and replies from people saying that they think the PS5 will go on sale at a certain time, but only because they assume retailers are going to pull what they did last week.

I understand this happened the first time, but the tweet from Playstation clearly says that retailers would share more details in the future. I took this as them telling us that the retailers would give us plenty of advance notice on what day and what time they would let us buy a PS5. It wouldn't make sense for Sony to apologize, and then have the same thing that happened last week happen again. I am absolutely certain retailers will give at least an hour notice in advance before the PS5 is available to purchase again, and they'll probably post that information on their Twitter. There's no reason to not assume this. ",PS5,48,0.45

What games is everyone getting in the first month the PS5 wil be out?," I'm probably going with: Demons Souls, Assassins Creed, Immortals: Fenyx Rising.

Oh I'm not the biggest fan of ubisoft. The only game series I still play  from them is assassins creed. And I know it will be mostly copy paste.  Like all their open world games. But yeah for some reason I still enjoy those mostly. Maybe someday we will get a new PoP.

Immortals Fenyx Rising actually looks like a better Zelda breath of the wild  clone. So I'm very interested in that after seeing 40min gameplay. So  here is crossing my fingers that this new IP turns out as great as the  demo looked.

Before someone mentions Cyberpunk; I'm probably going to wait until those PS5 specific upgrades are done. That  will probably take a few months. 

So yeah those 2 ubisoft games and demon souls is a great start. Better then only assassins creed IV and killzone on ps4 was.",PS5,106,0.63

Games from the PS3 that need a PS5 port or remaster:,"Sometimes a game doesn't always get its fair share because of programming of a console or it's just not the right time for that specific game. I definitely think there are some ps3 games that didn't get what they deserve and should be remastered for the PS5

1. Mod Nation Racers
This game is awesome. The best cart racer I've played in years. The major problem with this game was the horrendous loading screens. If we can get this game over to a system with an awesome ssd it can those once again. This game was better than Mario kart in my opinion. The customization was stellar. Sony needs to bring this one back in a remaster. Not much else needs to be changed. The game still holds up today.
2. Socom
Socom was Sony's first foray into online multiplayer and it killed the franchise after the PSN outage of 2011. This is no reason to kill that franchise. Getting this game back in a free to play type game could certainly boon Sony's first party presence. 
3. Resistance 1-3
These games are excellent scifi shooters with a great story. The weapon variety is imaginative in a very bleak world. Insomniac continues to tease these games. Getting us a remaster of these games would be awesome. 
4. Starhawk
Starhawk is an excellent. Real time combat and strategy military game. Building a base and creating ways to overcome your opponents in the game is a blast. With how online multiplayer has increased since this game it would be awesome to bring this back with customization options and adding even more game mode would be great. There aren't many games like it out there and the multiplayer of it was addicting.",PS5,93,0.62

The only real dilemma I have is that i’ll have to rebuy PS Plus and some games. I also won’t be able to use the cosmetics I unlocked in season 1 in Fall Guys.

While we wait for launch: day what’s your favorite PlayStation memory and why?,"Hi friends,

We don’t have too much time left before the state of this sub evolves into a proper console forum. Before we get there, I’ve been enjoying the casual posts on here so I want to chat about our favorite PlayStation memories.

I have a ton. I’m a Nintendo fanboy at heart, but Sony has always held a special place with me since the PS1. I think my favorite memories are tied to playing The Last of Us. Sure, the game is awe-inspiring, but it’s more about where I was at in life. I was a freshman in college, pretty aimless, and all the other tropes of being an early twenty-something year old. But playing through that game with the people in my life at the time was a very special thing. Not to get cheesy on everyone, but it’s like the quote  “I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”

When the PS4 launched, I played the Remastered version of the game. I would often leave the console idle and my theme at the time was this [one](https://youtu.be/Xr6OnQZUFW4). Hearing it idle now immediately takes me back to where I was living and the headspace I was in. And that was years and years ago.

Okay, I’m done getting nostalgic. What are YOUR favorite PlayStation memories?

Any interest in a Jurassic Park game for next-gen?,"Just finished watching Camp Cretaceous. Awesome show, definitely not for kids. Anyway...

It got me thinking, how come there is not a proper survival Jurassic Park game? The entire park, and you have to scavenge, look for food, water, weapons.

You have to cover your scent with Dino shit or piss, look for a map/gps to watch out for the territory which Dino is mostly roaming/found roaming in.

Get hunted by velociraptors, collectibles like finding books about how to possibly hunt/find info about specific dinosaurs, ala exhibits found in various parts of the park. 

Maintenance tunnels too, with the Park Adventure kayak/monorail.

Climb high canopies/climb trees, etc!

Roam through high grass and stumble upon corpses of dinosaurs, only to realize you stumbled upon a T-Rex nest

Canadian Gamers... tax on digital purchases?,Hello all. I am deciding whether to get the disc or digital PS5. Are we charged tax in Canada for digital purchases on the PS store?

What's the likelihood of Sony putting a PS3 emulating software on PS5 in the future?,"What do you think the likelihood is?

We've had a viable PS3 emulator on PC now for at least a couple of years, and it runs almost every PS3 game out there. If a small group of unpaid community members, investing free time and living off donations can do it, I'm sure it would be a joke for Sony to actually make one.

Personally, I'd even buy it as a one-time paid app if it meant I could play my PS3 discs and digital titles on my PS5. I'm glad they put in PS4 support, but I'm really hoping that maybe even in a year's time we see Sony contribute something towards PS3 backwards compatibility. It's a feature I want the most.

Something I think everyone is missing about the PS5 launch.,"I’m not perfect and I could be wrong so please correct me if any of this is incorrect.

I truly believe there is going to be large shortage of PS5s during the holiday season. Yes! Sony has said 15 million units but that’s within the first quarter of 2021. 

Sony has not said how many units will be available by this Christmas and the fact that there releasing in much more countries on launch day November 12th.

PS5/ Next Gen for the future of esports,"Ok ok, hear me out. With how powerful these consoles are going to be and how light most e-sports titles are, these could be some serious e-sports machines if Sony and/or Microsoft  wanted. 

Games like Overwatch or RS6 Siege for example. These consoles can seriously get great performance on these e-sports titles with 120 fps. It could allow for keyboard and mouse support and allow them to play on a separate server compared to controller only. Allowing for an easy entry into these e-sports titles while still being able to compete and hopefully play along side with the actual e-sports scene on these consoles.

All I am saying is these consoles could be a serious contender for streaming or playing e-sports titles if  Sony wanted to.",PS5,2,0.18
"First time PS player, looking for advice","Hey, I’m considering getting the PS5 to play with friends, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it.

My friends all currently have PS4s, and won’t be upgrading to the PS5 until next year at least. I‘ve read party chat will work between consoles, as well as a few games.

Would I have to buy the PS4 editions of those games to play with my friends, then buy the PS5 editions when they switch? Or do you think the library of backwards compatible games available at launch will even be enough to play with my PS4 friends?

Does this mean the PS5 can play regular blu ray discs as well as 4k Blu-ray? Is Blu-ray 3D any different?

Please Sony, make it able to deactivate the triggers when we're watching. Or stop using them altogether, or lock the joypad, turn it off with a quick one-press button combination, or something...! This would make a prefect console for me :) 

(I know this is prevalent on the other consoles too, but PS5 is where I'm headed, and the joypad triggers are more easily caught on my PS4 in my anecdotal experience)

"Considering the PS5 has similar internal structures to the PS4 Pro, (presumably) for supporting backwards compatibility, how is that not holding the PS5 back?","All this talk about the Series S, backwards compatibility and PS5 going cross gen but not much about how Sony accomplished PS4 backwards compatibility. Especially why it’s only PS4. 

Not even Sony is clear on if these games will be upgraded, only that they’re getting them to properly run or “take advantage of the Pro’s enhancements.” But the PS5 has the same amount of Compute Units as the PS4 Pro. Most likely a design choice for easy backwards compatibility, as opposed to Microsoft actually putting in effort to design their hardware to support all generations AND free visual upgrades across the board. 

What if the PS5 had 52 compute units, like the Series X, as opposed to 36, just like the PS4 Pro? Wouldn’t they be able to make even beefier games? 

Here’s Jim Ryan in 2017 responding to Sony’s backwards compatibility efforts[ “When we’ve dabbled with backwards compatibility, I can say it is one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much,” says Ryan. “That, and I was at a Gran Turismo event recently where they had PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 games, and the PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?”](https://time.com/4804768/playstation-4-ps4-pro-psvr-sales/) I highly doubt they’ve changed their tune in 2020 so I wouldn’t expect any older games getting visual upgrades because “why would anybody play this.” I guess.

It would be really interesting if they could add a functionality like what TrackIR does where it tracks the movement of the head like an extension of the right stick in games where there's freelook

An example of this could be seen in Gran Turismo, imagine you are racing in the cockpit view and want to see how close a car is to your side,  so instead of using the minimap or using the right stick to view left or right, you just turn your head a little and the camera looks in that direction

Regional Pricing. A Brief Look.,"The conversation about the increase in games prices has been dominated by the $10 increase in the USA but its important to see how these prices have changed worldwide especially with the digital only PS5. 

UK £55 -&gt; £70   an increase by  $19.37 to  $90.42  

EU  € 70 -&gt;  € 80 an increase by  $11.84  to $94.73

Aus $100 -&gt; $125 an increase by $18.23 to $91.15

Jpn   ¥7,590 - &gt; ¥7,900 an increase by $2.96 to $75.55  

California\* (after sales tax) $ 64.95 -&gt; $75.77  an increase of $10.82

&amp;#x200B;

America has had increadible games prices in comparison to the rest of the world. Sony's implementation of regional pricing is completely screwing over the EU/UK/Aus and treats them as second class in comparison. This jump to next gen is pricing out gamers worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Regional pricing sucks. 

\*Used California as an example as i know it has a relatively high tax rate compared to the rest of the USA but i don't fully understand the variation in the USA. 

\*\* Used Ghost of Tsushima PSN prices to compare things to in comparison to the published Playstation blog prices for Demon Souls.",PS5,285,0.87

Is 825GB enough space for you?,"I'm curious to hear honest opinions here.  Is 825GB enough space for you?

If it's not enough space for you, why?  Do you honestly keep that many games installed at once that you ACTUALLY play?

I'm still using the 500GB drive that came in my PS4, and I keep my favorites installed just in case I decide I want to play them, and then I keep the games I'm actively playing / working on installed, and I've not really had any space issues.

The only time I had a space issue is when I recently tried to install several new games that I wanted to play eventually.  I didn't need them all installed right then, and some of them I still haven't had time to touch yet, and that issue was fixed by simply removing one old game I hadn't played in well over a year.

**Best**: Original Piano Black PS3 - It just screamed luxury and premium quality. A truly beautiful console to look at.

**Worst**: All PS4 builds. They are built superbly well, but I don't like the odd shape choice and the loose plastic buttons that you can find on  nearly variant of the console.

**Afterthoughts**: I actually love the new design choice for the PS5 consoles. It's a pastiche of the 80s Mars colony buildings combined with the look of modern architecture. I think that Sony has recaptured their design magic again.",PS5,20,0.47

Is God of War sequel in 2021 really too early?,Considering God of War started development in 2014 and released in 2018. That’s a 4 year dev cycle. On top of that if you’ve seen the making of documentary then you might know how chaotic the development of God of War was. The development wasn’t supposed to start till after the new IP Santa Monica was making but it was canned and the entire team was mov d to God of War production prematurely which created a lot pipeline issues with people constantly waiting on someone else to finish something that they needed to finish something else. Not to mention Sony has said they’ve expanded their studios in an attempt to increase the frequency of releases.

PS Plus Bundle and Remasters,"Considering there are 18 games in the bundle, 10 of which are PlayStation exclusives, does this mean those games wont be getting a remaster on PS5? I heard a lot of rumours about a Bloodborne remaster with better framerates, but if its bundled into this collection, then I cant see them making another version on top of this. On the other hand, they want to showcase some of the best games in the PS Plus collection for new players, and nobody wants to play a stuttering 30fps game on their new PS5, so maybe all 18 of these games will get a graphical and frame rate upgrade just for the PS5?

I would have expected a game like Spider-Man to be in this bundle if it wasn't for the fact its being remastered and included in the Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.

I mean seriously. PS4 BC is great. Its an awesome feature. Would i like PS1-2-3 BC? Sure. But its not worth complaining about.

Also, are PS Now subscription cards country specific (I see websites have UK, Ger, Aus sub cards etc...)?

"Digital Vs Physical Gaming? What should you choose, a little guide by me.","\_\_This is a guide, so best you read it full thoroughly to get some information and some tips. It's for new players or for those who are quite late in PS4 era who are confused deciding whether to buy PS5 digital or PS5 Physical edition? While old PS4 players are also welcomed, who knows what might change your mind?\_\_

Let's get this straight! I will be telling pros and cons of digital games, while cons being obviously pros of physical game. This guide will then proceed forward to next topic of who should switch? Ending with important NOTES.

\*\*Pros:\*\*

\*Digital games are not physical entities, therefore they are damage proof, scratch proof, water-proof, dust-proof, overall they can't be destroyed, which means in case something like natural calamity happens like a earthquake your huge physical library will just came crashing down with all your sweet games discs shattered into pieces (off topic but Nintendo users are safe from most this stuff). While over time your physical games will accumulate scratches and small damages which may render them useless or make them full of problems to play on a console as it couldn't read the disk properly.

\*Digital games are very easy to access. Imagine you want to play all your games just for fun and you have this huge ass physical library. With digital games, and with now the power of PS5 fast SSD you don't have to stand up, and sit down again and again in your couch for changing the disks just exit the game and start next one. Laziness on another level, but that's what every one wants right? But with many games you might end up using HDD which will slow down your load time, but hey! You still haven't stood up from your cozy couch, so it's a win win!

\*Digital games let's you experience a true day one launch. Imagine you have this game (CYBERPUNK 2077) and you are so hype for this you decorated your whole room with posters, changed wallpapers of your devices to that damn beautiful night city and now just waiting for the release to happen. But wait? If you have digital copy, you can just pre load the game on to your console and start playing exactly from the time the game is launched! HYPE ++, but alas you have ordered physical copy, which will take days to come. While all your fav youtubers and friends are enjoying the game while you are sitting and just waiting for your game to come. HYPE : (

\*Digital games go wherever you go! Let's say you are rich af and have over 1000 games in your library, or not so rich but still have a nice 50 games in your library. Now you are going to a vacation for few weeks to a nice spot but don't have enough space to carry all your 1000/50 games with you at once, leaving to you only mere 10-20 games you have. Well Digital games have no problem like that, no matter how many games you have you can take them with your PS5 anywhere and whenever you like, just pick up PS5 and go. (considering you have enough storage solution to store all the games, otherwise you could download them too, I mean not bad considering you don't have to worry about disks right?) Even bad when you are shifting your home you have to take headache of taking them too, and if some mishappening occurs, your disk, well goodbye.

\*\*Cons:\*\* \*Enough I guess, let's make all physical gamers too happy about themselves too!\*

\*Digital games are just yours, which means you can't lend them to your far off friends, and in case you made a bad purchase and refund system is not available or you just don't want that game anymore, well you can't resell them. With digital games your money spent is just spent and you can't get it back anyway , while physical games can be shared, re-sold, and can be given for rent, Overall you can do whatever you want , keep, throw whatever, which means you are in CONTROL! And who doesn't like being in control ?

\*Physical games have not to be downloaded again and again. Imagine you need to download a new game, but you don't have space, and you delete a digital game. But later you got some space and you need to download that 50GB game again. Well congrats! The game you just downloaded before have to be downloaded again with net you paid for. While physical games have no such things. Just insert the disc, download minor updates\*, or hell even start playing without updating the game. No need to worry about deleting a game and thinking you need to download it again. Physical games save so much data for real. (\*doesn't consider updates of modern warfare 2019). And if you live in a bad internet area, then well buying a digital console is just like Going to school without books.

\*Physical games get cheaper faster. So you are not rich af and can't own 1000 games, but you are a gamer by heart and need those sweet juicy exclusives for your ps5, and luckily you are a physical gamer! Well physical games get way faster cheaper than digital ones. Both launch at same prices, but the digital stays on that grossing 60 dollars for months. Even after a year they hardly go below 30 while physical games can be get for like 10-15 dollars from ebay. Now that's what i call a deal!(NOTE: I only took data of around first two years based on my country experience, for more time than this, digital games get way cheaper than their physical brothers most of the time, with few exceptions. Results might differ in your country so see a little statistics of prices of games)

\*Physical games are great for show-off. Now you got some guests in your house, or a annoying child who treats you like shit when you are at his home. They all see your huge gaming library in all it's glory with those physicals cases and those fancy artwork and names written in their spine reading (GRAND THEFT AUTO V). And they all just see that awestruck while you stand their smiling on your beautiful collection. With digital games, meh. If you decided to open your PS5 then it's only possible moreover those fancy cases with artworks and physical items are still no match for those digital photos (it's another level feeling to hold a game in your hands). Physical games are just good for anyone who likes to praise their collection and see them all day and say, it's beautiful, I have seen it for 5 hours now.

\*Physical version doesn't steal your digital fun right? SO yeah by spending 100 more dollars you can get a console that do both physical and digital, and if you are kind of hybrid guy, then this is a extra pros of physical version for everyone.

So that's all I guess. If there are enough please tell me, I will add them here. And I hope that answer much of your questions, so you either have decided till now which is better and what to go with. But you still confused? Well then here comes PS PLUS

\*\*PS PLUS:\*\* I tell you about how good is ps plus actually, consider reading it or skip to conclusion.

\*I intend no console war, these are just my opinion. Xbox game pass is great but that doesn't make PS PLUS weak anyday. Read full.\*

It's a subscription service which gives you 2 free games every month (oof everyone knows that, now's the real deal) For just 60 dollars a year you get 2 top titles to keep every month. Fall Guys, Morder warfare 2 remastered, Street fighter V, PUBG are some of the recent amazing games that this subscription has given. And if you are having this subscription for multiple years like 4 years then you have probably made a 100+ games library which has games even better than whole xbox game pass (except flight sim ofcourse, that game is too amazing imo to be beaten by any PS exclusive). So when you think critically PS PLUS is much more financial and give you much better games than xbox game pass. HOW? LEMME EXPLAIN!

You get two great games, say fall guys, you played it for month and then you get another games while you keep all your previous games. You can continue playing whatever you like. Like this a casual gamer will be happy with these offerings, and don't need to worry about running dry of games, and occasionally you will get top hits like uncharted 4, last of us, or hell even blood borne (GOD OF WAR isn't free until now, so get your damn horses cause it will most probably follow every other exclusive and be free before ragnarok release, only prediction though but quite undeniable). So a see you just pay 300 dollars for 5 years and get over thousands of dollar worth of games while xbox game pass for consoles cost 120 dollars a year(as it cost 10 dollars a month) i.e. 600 dollars for 5 years (holy hell) , with those extra 300 dollars you could buy so great exclusives during sale, while ultimate cost 900 dollars for 5 years . If you don't have pc, then very well, microsoft played you very well (considering some games exit the service too, and xbox live games are so bad most of the games are not even recognizable by many people). And if you have pc powerful enough to play those games, then this is ever better than PS PLUS any day handsdown. In PS PLUS games are being added in your library one by one. Now in xbox game pass they throw all games at once, and as I know you won't be playing every game right? Only 10-20 or ok even till 50. But you still paying for others game you don't play? See the point? That's the secret behind game pass successful model. No console wars here, but to proof that PS PLUS is a very great and financial subscription model for all casual gamers and that many people actually play the game they paid that 60 dollars for. You can buy just exclusives and few other top titles like cyberpunk while all other gaming needs would be fulfilled by a cheap 60 dollars subscription service which grants more than those free games for a whole year wow. See your library once, they are full of gems and you didn't even notice them. PS PLUS is literally a very great subscription service I ever came in hand with considering you not only get free games but other benefits too! (This is all obvious when you see the long run and not short run. This doesn't mean Xbox game pass is bad it's great, but I just wanna prove that PS PLUS is very great subscription model, and I love sony for this as much as I love xbox for their services)

In PS5 you get a PS+ collection which give you instant access to more games, even some you have missed in regular giveaways.

\*\*So after all this we can come to 3 conclusion:\*\* These are my opinion.

1: If you are totally new, then go with digital (but not when you have bad net. No chance. See if you have some cyber cafe or some place with fast net nearby to download games, otherwise you only have one option). Digital is only best option for casual new gamers rightaway. Sure cost of exclusives are 70 dollars? But you can either stick with you PS PLUS games, and wait for a sale, or just buy that yeah. I mean how often are exclusives released? Trust me, PS PLUS games will keep you busy for months and now you have that PS PLUS collection along with free gta online for first free months too! As you are totally new, you probably wanna buy old games which are obviously dead cheap during PS PLUS double discount sales

2: If you are PS4 gamer, and have quite small physical collection and wanna play new games rightaway, then go with digital. Prices are same for both version initially so it wouldn't bother you much. While see how many games you want from you small physical collection, sell all of those and buy digital version on sale (as they will be very cheap now, mostly).

3: If you are either rich af physical guy, or wanna buy exclusives/games for very cheap just after few months of release, go with physical. Although i would suggest try bending towards digital as i don't see physical games working for such huge budget games in future, but as for now, yeah physical PS5 edition is quite viable and you can enjoy them surely for next console genration.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*NOTES:\*\* These are some important thing i wanna share, suggest me more if you think so.

\*DriveClub digital edition is not available. So if you wanna play this game badly, go with physical or just ditch this game for good.

\*With games getting update and patches as big as MODERN WARFARE, moreover blu-ray disk achieving their capacity , it is safe to assume digital media is what everyone have to do mostly. Honestly if you could update modern warfare then you could download any game (except if your intentions are far beyond my imagination)

\*This guide as told was designed for totally new players or quite late players in PS4. Although I have gave conclusion covering as much audience available.

\*Overall you are the one to decide I just given you a direction, but ultimately you have your own decisions so make whatever suits you best. I hope I helped you significantly with this guide.

\*(Physical gamers)Also if the game is asking for mandatory update, try deleting the game, and then open your PS4 offline and then insert disk and start game upon installing. Most of the time it will work, but you just have not to go PS4 online again if you don't wanna update. But if not possible it's probably because of NOTE number 2

\*Don't Buy PSNOW and EAPLAY with PS PLUS at all. PS PLUS is great and you need just time to make a good library. Sony licensing thing is quite messed like PS5 pre-orders, and if some game is given free by EA PLAY or PS NOW, and it was previously given free on PS PLUS, the current license of PSNOW and EA PLAY will override the PS PLUS license and if the games exit the service, there are high chances your PS PLUS library game will also be gone. SO don't buy any other service as it messes all sorts of licensing things.

\*\*EXTRA TIP FOR PLAYERS WHO READ TILL LAST:\*\* Hmm did I wrote this good or you felt click baited?

Ok, now time for a extra tip which is legal (ooh!) and might be life savior. For all you players who read till here, cause that's what heroes do right?

Say you got a whole bunch of library of digital games. But one day you do something and you get permanently banned, and literally you become now broke af, frustrated af, and angry af. But all of that could be prevented, if you did this one thing.

First of all make two legal accounts on PSN (by legal I mean everything you enter should be 100% accurate and no faking of anything, seriously). One with which you purchase games, and another with which you will play games now. Log both accounts in to your PS4. Now with you main account, buy games , PS PLUS membership and set it as primary. And with your play account play your games. Now if you get banned you will lose all your game progress. But hey those sweet games and your PS PLUS library are still saved in your another account right? Make another account and play your games (again from starting though, rip my 2000 hours in SKRIM)

However I honestly condemn racial shit and slurs, in online gaming. If you do it, you are the lowest scum in this earth. However I found out this method because company can ban you many times for no obvious reason, and then we have nothing to do except remorse.

So this was my method, it's working great from 2 years for me. And it will do so cause it's not illegal to buy games in an account and don't play it in it lol? And hope this method will make you feel more good about buying digital games, as it was considered one of the biggest problems of digital gaming, that your whole library is r/whoooshed if you get banned. That's why I didn't state it as a pros or con, cause here is the solution (for anyone wondering). And save files are lost both in physical and digital method as they are tied to your account.

So that's it all I had to share. I hope it was much helpful for you, and I hope you have a great next gen gaming experience. Was having free time so decided to spend it by helping others.

It's nice to see some level of commitment to having these sort of games on the system and putting them in the forefront.

I can remember there being a lot of big games like this in the PS1/2 era, but as time has gone on, the ps3/4 trended more adult in what they were pushing.

Is there any info on how it works on PS5? Will it allow one account to be set as primary on PS4 and PS5 at the same time. Basically allowing all the PS4 games to be played using another accounts in the consoles

Does the PS5 launch remind you of the PS2?,"Does anyone else get that weird, nostalgic feeling from the days of the PS2 launch? I remember growing up the PS2 was so elusive and wanted because it literally did everything (playing DVDs). While 4K Blu-ray isn't as big compared to media 20 years ago, Sony is literally using the same advertising tactics and marketing push for the PS5. I have to say, it's got me quite excited as a whole.

While I have always liked other consoles and handhelds too, Sony has a penchant for hitting the right marketing notes.

"PSVR might not work with the new PS5 HD camera, so maybe keep hold of your old PS4 camera.","As the old saying goes: ""To assume is to make an ass of u &amp; me.""

According to a careful reading of the [accessories section on Sony's own PS5 page](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/ps5/accessories/) it details the new PS5 ""HD camera"" with zero mention of it's use with PSVR. However immediately below the link that takes you to the [PS5 HD camera's own page (which also has zero mention of it's use with PSVR)](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/accessories/hd-camera/) is the following text:

"PS5 does not ship with TOSLink. This is potentially a problem, but I have a solution.","I haven't seen anyone discussing this recently, or going anywhere with analysis on the ports. I'm going to be mainly discussing the issue of the missing TOSLink connector, but I will highlight two other points. 

#Firstly, the figure-8 power cable. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320

Previous console releases saw launch PS3 and PS4 consoles use what's commonly (and incorrectly) called a kettle cord. The connector is actually part of the IEC 60320 standard for electrical connections. Some people associate its use with lower-power devices.

On the launch PS3, Sony used the C14 inlet design, which is pretty popular with PSU vendors for PCs (among other things like audio equipment). For the PS4 and PS4 Pro, Sony switched to the C18 plug. This has compatibility with C13 cables, and the ratings are just about the same. The only physical difference is that the plug was not designed to be rewirable and it lacks an earth pin.

Later consoles like the PS3 Slim, the PS3 with the sliding tray, and the PS4 Slim all use the C8 inlet connector. The notable difference is that it is only rated for 2.5A power draws by the IEC. Some vendors will exceed this spec and draw up to 10A, but the use of C8 is attractive because it doesn't have a polarity requirement. Sony has chosen wisely because they can use the smaller connector and still be within the IEC spec to power the PS5.

2.5 Amps at 120V is 300 Watts. Similarly, 1.25Amps at 240V is also 300 Watts. Use of the C8 inlet connector is perfectly in line with the expected 250W power draw of this console. Xbox Series S and X also make use of the C8 connector, which is a nice way to cut down on waste plastic, and the console ends up being slimmer.

~~Also, this practically means that both PS5 and the Xbox Series S and X will ship with a power brick.~~ It doesn't, actually. Ignore my dumbassed comment on this one. I wrote all this at 1AM.

#Next, the hidden SSD bay.

https://imgur.com/MeagAc1

In hands-on time with the dummy Xbox Series S, you may have noticed that the unit has holes drilled above the SSD cart slot. The Series X doesn't need this, as there are already gigantic vents above the slot for the split motherboard design. 

Where would the PS5 put them? On the bottom. In the render that we saw this week, there are two sets of vents on the bottom of the console. One has a blanked-out port that is clearly meant to accommodate the same size SSD carts as the Xbox Series S and X. The second set of vents might be there just to pull in some air over the power circuitry. This means that closing off these vents is a big no-no.

https://imgur.com/8gO3Ke1

In fact, looking at the stand for the PS5 you can clearly see that it raises the console off the ground with a wide gap for fresh air intake, and it forms a tunnel underneath the console. The rear shot shows the stand rising up to meet the back of the chassis where it clearly clips on, and the rear of the stand is also open. Good ventilation is key for SSD longevity, so keep this in mind when you're shoving your expensive toy into a closet.

Edit: Regulatory filings have pictures of the bottom, and there is no SSD bay. There are still vents, but my speculation was incorrect on this one. 

#But let's talk about TOSLink.

https://imgur.com/JlPTouV

[The Series X had TOSLink.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/esa8nq/xbox_series_x_rear_port_setup_revealed_in_new/) You can see it right there next to the USB ports on the leaked prototypes. [It's not on the Series S](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21865124/twarren_200908_4177_0005.0.jpg), presumably to help meet the lower cost threshold.

PS5 likely never had it. This is a minor headache for anyone who owns a speaker set that isn't acting as a receiver for their surround sound. I don't know what most of r/PS5 owns, but Sony clearly thinks that most people will just plug the console via HDMI into the TV and job done. But how will anyone that doesn't have a receiver that does HDMI Passthru hook up the console to their surround sound?

Most TVs can fill a room with sound, but it's invariably awful quality. Some of you might be snazzy enough to own a TV with a matching sound bar, or a reciever which is HDMI 2.1 capable and HDCP 2.2 compatible. But in the spirit of not adding to electronic waste, I now have to look around for a rather expensive HDMI-to-TOSLink splitter (at almost 10% of the cost of a PS5 with shipping). Most of the cheaper commercially available units aren't HDCP 2.2 compatible, and they have to be powered. And there are compatibility problems. 

For example, Astro now has to bundle in a compatible splitter with their headsets for PS5 [that they designed](https://www.destructoid.com/stories/here-s-how-your-astro-gaming-headsets-will-work-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-601913.phtml). This is because most cheap, commercially available splitters do not properly support Dolby 5.1 or Dolby Digital Plus, even if it says it does on the box. Better still, many of these devices don't pass through HDMI signaling without some issue like monitor flickering, or FreeSync not working, or converting a 4K signal down to 4:2:2 instead of passing through 4:4:4 because there's not enough bandwidth available (which also affects HDR support).

Truth be told, a lot of receivers with HDMI passthru don't handle this well either. Some of them have an HDMI CEC implementation that is buggy and doesn't pass through ARC audio correctly, others will break HDCP and drop to a lower version of the standard. Separating the audio outputs makes sense given how disjointed HDMI is generally.

But I don't know why they had to make their own when there are commercial options out there. Maybe they really mean they just rebranded a Kanex Pro?

This one might do the trick for my setup, as well as most others: https://www.kanexpro.com/item/?id=HAECOAX3. But don't think of it as a splitter, because that's the wrong term for what's actually going on here - it's extracting audio from an HDMI signal and simultaneously outputing it to whatever else supports audio input. There's still sound being transmitted via HDMI. This is more like a vampire tap that allegedly does not break HDCP.

So if you're using an older audio setup and plan to buy one of the new consoles - hopefully a PS5 - you can still use your older TOSLink cables just fine so long as you plan for purchasing another dohickey to make the old thing work with the new thing. This should also allow older high-end wireless headsets that uses the optical out on PS3 and PS4 to continue working.",PS5,36,0.47

Maybe unpopular opinion: No game has shown off interesting uses of the new SSD,"I don't want to downplay how good it is that loading screens will become a thing of the past, but now that we know that Miles Morales and the new Horizon are also coming to PS4, their open-worlds are not designed to be handled exclusively by PS5 tech. While pushing more polygons at higher framerates is great, I'm disappointed that we won't get to see an open world game that really takes advantage of the tech such that gameplay itself feels refreshing. Less waiting during fast travel isn't a gameplay feature that will alter your moment-to-moment experience. It cannot do so by design so that PS4 players get a similar experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Only Ratchet and Clank seems to be attempting anything tied to the PS5, but to be honest the implementation there is also disappointing in my opinion. All sequences where you're hopping between dimensions seem (at least for now) highly scripted and on-rails. Visually, they're great and interesting, but the gameplay would be the same if you weren't hopping around between dimensions. The ""grapple"" item is also very disappointing.

There will be more preorders for launch and here's why,"Little bit of maths and theory around this so grab your hats

EB Games sold out their 75,000 PS5 allocation in 1hr in Australia. Preorders for JB HIFI, Big W and Harvey Norman are also sold out awaiting Sony's next allocation of stock with no timeline suggested to date.

Ignoring Amazon and Sony's allocations, let's go through the maths based of the $50 preorder charge each of those stores requested when ordering:

75000 units X 4 suppliers X $50aus = $15,000,000

If the stores give all of their $50 booking fees to Sony (unlikely but for the sake of argument), Sony has acquired $15 million from Australia alone to secure future deliveries of PS5s for the region.


I'll bet that although the first preorders were crazy and unorganised, Sony is using these new funds to resupply the demand, and more launch day preorders will be available and accessible to (almost) everyone.

That's my hope anyway",PS5,5,0.3

"Why buy the PS5 SKU of Spider-Man: Miles Morales, when the PS4 SKU is cheaper and offers a free upgrade?","This is a legitimate question about the base game.

If, according to the blog post, the PS4 version gives you access to the PS5 version then why would you spend more getting that version if its not needed?

Or have I completely misunderstood this post and the PS4 SKU doesn't support the enhancements when upgraded to PS5.

COD Cold War Opens your eyes to what the “Next Gen” enhancements truly are.,"Playing the COD Cold War Alpha is a very good way of opening your eyes to how lighting and reflections will make the game look “next gen”. Seeing the trailers and PS5 gameplay, the game is stunning with Reflections in the right places and lighting just right, while when playing the Alpha it shows how obvious it is that it’s missing these next gen features. Jumping into the Alpha I was actually surprised to how much that actually improves the experience and “immersion” as a whole due to the alpha not being able to show these features on console. Seeing the floors as a reflective surface but no reflections is something I never really noticed in COD before but seeing the PS5 event backed up by the Alpha opened my eyes to how much better a game can look with these elements. Honestly can’t wait till the release of the PS5 and this is further proof as to why I should be excited.",PS5,88,0.6

One thing I hope Sony sticks with is announcing their games closer to launch and trying to surprise us with release dates for those games.,"It's gotten kind of lost in the pre-order mess but I still can't quite get over the fact that 5 of the 9 first party titles announced in June will release day 1 on PS5. That is amazing.

Same with the fact that R&amp;C is coming ""launch window"" and that a God of War sequel is, for now, slated for next year.

What's really cool about this, aside from those games being close, is that it breaks with the traditional expectation we have for Sony games taking years to come out after their announcement, especially when they get announced with no release window. How often did I read between June and now that the PS5 only had Spider-Man for launch and that all those other games could release who knows when? Now all of these preconceptions are out the window and I kind of love it and hope it continues like that.

When Horizon FW was announced for 2021, the internet was full of snarky comments about how that would actually mean 2022. But now? Who knows maybe the game is targeting summer or even spring. It's a cross gen title after all.

What about Returnal? Or GT7? After the suprises from this week they could release as early as next spring and I wouldn't be shocked.

Maybe there are even more games planned for next year that they just didn't announce yet.

There's something exciting about the idea of being able to start a year without knowing 100% what games you will be able to play by the end of it and I hope Sony is able and willing to continue this trend they've now started with the PS5.",PS5,31,0.87

Anyone else see Sony hinting towards the future of PSnow with PS+ collection?,"For a while now there have been rumours that the PSnow service may be thrown into a combo pack with PSplus, or even be added to the existing subscription.  Hell, a lot of the games they  announced in this collection are already in PSnow.

Fuel has recently been added to this fire by the PS+ collection... pretty much doing what the PSnow games do. While this could potentially be just an added extra for people buying PS+ at launch, similar to how Nintendo gave out a bunch of GBA games to early 3DS owners, it could also be the first step in marrying the 2 services. 

Love PSnow or hate it, but it has numerous flaws. Such as inferior versions of games like the PS3 edition of Shadow of colossus instead of the PS4's being on there, the nathan drake collection not being on there but the PS3 edition being there, and the same goes for the Last of Us. There is also no PS1 support, PS3 games can't be downloaded like PS2 and 4 can and so on and so forth

Guide for people who're planning to buy Cyberpunk 2077 and are wondering which hardware or next gen console to chose on launch day.,"\- If you have RTX cards, choose PC all the way. Game will support DLSS, which mean you can play kinda-4k with much higher FPS

\- If you have potato PC (like GTX950), choose PS5. Game will be at least PS4 pro version on PS5, we just don't know what kind of improvements we'll get from day one - but I assume that would be better textures, bigger resolution, 60 FPS. The ""robust"" upgrade in 2021 will probably include better optimization, even better textures and ray tracing (and maybe support for haptics and 3d audio)

\- If you are in my position (medium ranged non-RTX PC, 1660 super, Ryzen 5 3600), then it's a bit...harder choice. The game may look better on your PC on launch, but in long term it'll surely look much, much better on PS5. Unfortunately, you're gonna have to wait few months or year for that. So:

\---&gt; If you plan to play it only once, choose your PC. But note that the game will get free upgrades, DLCs and multiplayer during it's life cycle.

\---&gt; If you plan to play the shit out of this game more than once, choose PS5. Your first playthrough may be worse in terms of aesthetics, but next ones gonna support Ray Tracing and awesome (hopefully) optimization. With PS5 specs, I'm sure the game will look almost as awesome as on trailers.

You’ll also see ray-traced reflections and ambient shadows, improved lighting, more pedestrians and vehicles stretching further into the distance, and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate. We’ll be supporting near-instant loading, 3D audio, and the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback.

The reason why exclsives are 70 dollars instead of 60.,"This may not be completely accurate but I think I know the reason why sony is charging 70 dollars (note that this is speculation based on statements made by people related to PS5 and its games). On 17th of September Jim Ryan, the CEO of playstation said that “The PS5 versions of those games (cross gen games) are built from the ground up to take advantage of the PS5 feature set, and we have an upgrade path for PS4 users to get the PS5 versions for free. It’s about people having choice. I’m really quite pleased about the situation.” 

Now we all know that when it comes to cross gen games that you make the game for the current gen system and then scale it up to the next gen system but however if what he says is true then insomniac and gurella are making two versions of each game separately, a ps4 version and a ps5 version that’s apparently built from the “ground up” for the ps5. Doesn’t this imply that these devs have to do more compex things like change the design of the game instead of simply scaling it up for the PS5 which is no doubt more cheaper then what Ryan has described? They are probably charging 70 dollars because they spent a ton of money making both versions of these games like this.",PS5,67,0.13

I’m in South Africa and PlayStation just released the local pricing this side and well, the gaming community is pissed, the prices are ridiculous at R12k (disc) and R10k (digital). 

A direct conversion to the USD for the disk PS5 would be equivalent to purchasing the console at $700.

How do we not know ANYTHING about the UI,I literally just bought a console that I have no idea what its like to use... I mean all we really know about the actual experience of using a ps5 is that it plays games well.

Screen capture/game recording predictions?,"Personally I think it might be able to capture at least 1080p at 60. Maybe it will have a higher bitrate than the PS4 so the image is cleaner. Also it would be neat to be able to capture at 4K30 or maybe 1440p 30. The higher amount of ram and overall better specs should allow this. Might we might  see 720p 120fps?. It would be really nice but I doubt that'll happen

I don't know if HDR capture is a thing but it would be nice if possible. Again I don't know if it is.

What do you all think of what the screen recording can do? I hope it's better than what the PS4 has but not by much. Obviously a dedicated screen capture card is better since it doesn't need the consoles power to capture so it can capture much higher quality video. A lower bitrate/higher compression is important for console's built in screen capture so it doesn't take up too much space.",PS5,7,0.29

"Is anyone concerned/curious about Destruction All Stars? It’s a launch game and we haven’t seen much of it. I’m a little wary of this one, especially at $70!","We saw a brief trailer for this at the PS5 reveal, but since then? We’ve seen squat! Seems kind of ironic and weird that with DSA and Demons Souls  both being launch titles, we’ve seen less of these two games than we have games coming out AFTER launch like Ratchet and Clank:RA and Deathloop. 

However, with Demons Souls it’s more understandable why we haven’t seen so much of the game, as after all, it’s a remake and most people who haven’t played the original are familiar with what’s Souls games are like. With Destruction All Stars we really know very little of this. Also, they are charging a full premium $70 price point for this thing. That seems really expensive given the game looks like a mostly online focused affair. Does the game even have a single player campaign? I really hope Sony sheds some more light on this one in the coming weeks. Sony really should given us even a brief gameplay demonstration at the event on the 16th. I REALLY THINK they could’ve skipped showing stuff like DMC5, Fortnite, and above all Five Nights At Freddys to allocate the time to show this game off. Especially, since as I’ve said, it’s a full priced launch title.

The Potential design of Cross Gen games moving into this generation.,"As many of you know, Sony plans to release PS4 versions of Spiderman: Miles Morales and Horizon: Forbidden West. Now with the announcement of these a storm of controversy surrounding these two titles sprouted about how they will hold back the potential scope of these games, which is where I have this question. Do you guys think Sony built two separate distinct versions of the games with the PS5 versions having extra mechanics in game due to the upgraded specs and not just a boost in the visuals department. For example, say in Miles Morales the swinging speed was capped in the PS4 version due to hardware limitations but in the PS5 version it wasn’t (A very arbitrary idea but plausible nonetheless). Or how about there being flying machines in Forbidden West that you can interact with on the PS5 version but not on the last gen version. I know this all may be wishful thinking, but I’m really just hoping the scope of these games wasn’t limited and that the PS4 versions were more afterthought that Sony thought they could capitalize on with the large install base. I still do think it is a really nice gesture to provide these games to late adopters to the platform, but I just want these games to be the best they can be gameplay wise. Graphically, we can already see they are with that stunning Miles Morales footage but is there more to it than that? What do you guys think?


TLDR: Will Cross Gen games be built fundamentally different or will last gen continue to hold back some aspects of game design on PlayStation. What approach will Sony take?",PS5,64,0.66

Hopefully We Quickly Get a Pro Version of The Dualsense controller Or Licensed Third Party Controller Options,"Really excited for the PS5, but the lack of a pro controller option doesn't sound appealing. After playing PS4 with a licensed third party controller the past few years and having back buttons/paddles, it's gonna be tough to adjust to having no back buttons. Those buttons really are a gamechanger, not just for competitive games, but also a huge source of comfort/convenience in single player games.

I really thought that Sony releasing the back button attachment for the Dualshock 4 meant that PS5 controllers would see these buttons becoming standard. But doesn't look like that's gonna be the case. 

Hopefully Sony can fix this issue by releasing a pro version of the Dualsense controller with back buttons, or at least licensing the design out so that third party companies can make one.",PS5,69,0.6

You should be pisses at the journalists for misleading readers re: cross gen games,"[The Jim Ryan article in question](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-29-sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5)

**The Claim:** There will be no cross gen games.

&gt; One way to keep PS4 users engaged would be to make upcoming PS5 games playable on the older machine, just like Microsoft is proposing with its Xbox Series X games being playable on Xbox One. **Yet Ryan says that's not something PlayStation is interested in doing.**

Ryan's quotes on the PS4:

&gt; **""We have always felt that we had a responsibility to serve that [PS4] community for several years after the launch of PS5 and that it represented a huge business opportunity for us**,"" Ryan says. ""The numbers are quite straightforward. If you say in broad brush figures that we have a community of 100 million PS4 owners right now, and in the first couple of years... I don't know, somewhere between 15 and 25 million might migrate to PS5, that still leaves a huge number of people with PS4s. And that community is demonstrating an amazing stickiness, and willingness to stay engaged that, I think, the events of the past few months have just reinforced what we knew already.

On PS5:

&gt; ""We have always said that we believe in generations. We believe that **when you go to all the trouble of creating a next-gen console, that it should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include.** And that, in our view, people should make games that can make the most of those features.

&gt; ""We do believe in generations, and whether it's **the DualSense controller, whether it's the 3D audio, whether it's the multiple ways that the SSD can be used**... we are thinking that it is time to give the PlayStation community something new, something different, that can really only be enjoyed on PS5.""

When he spoke about believing in generations he did not mention anything about no cross gen games. He was clearly talking about adding new features that comes with every new console.

He did not mention that Playstation is not interested in cross-gen games. The article writer implied it with no reason.

He specifically mentions supporting the PS4 and userbase after PS5 launch.

The article writer, and subsequent journalists basing it on this article have clearly misinterpreted (deliberately or not) what he said.",PS5,132,0.54

I was so sure of this plan until yesterday’s showcase. A $299 (379 CAD) box with all the next-gen features (- resolution) with Game Pass seemed a very seductive entrance to the Xbox ecosystem.

Notice how even PS3 models CECHA01 and CECHB01, which have the PlayStation 2’s Emotion Engine AND the Graphics Synthesizer chip onboard, aren’t guaranteed full compatibility w/PS2 software.

Note that these PS3’s did lack the PS1’s R3000 chip which, according to My Life in Gaming, was utilized by some developers in PS2 software, and thus had to emulate the R3000 through CELL, but it does set the precedent that Sony won’t promise 100% compatibility even when a majority of the backward-compatibility is rooted in original hardware, let alone the PS5’s PS4/Pro performance profiles through similarly-architected hardware.",PS5,16,0.3

Edit: I don't expect GTA VI until 2023-2024, but it still nice to go over and who's knows Rockstar may release a remake of the first Red Dead Redemption since it never got ported to pc and rdr2 was pretty successful so it may happen so they could bring more players into red dead online that way aswell, I feel red dead redemption marketing will be different than GTA since red dead redemption is story driven and it would be a really good remake aswell, probably one of the biggest game remakes ever besides FF7 but they really should remastered Max payne 3 or try remaking the first max payne in the future but that probably will never happen with max payne anyways and it just nice to discuss. A new max payne probably wouldn't sell well compared to a remake of rdr1.",PS5,6,0.32

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

Also plan on getting watchdogs, cyberpunk and maybe assassins's creed as well - BUT I will be buying all of these as PS4 versions though...

Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5.

If they revived an old favorite via sequel or remake for the new generation of consoles what would titles would get you genuinely excited?,"I absolutely love video games and although I would never really call myself a hard-core gamer, especially after having kids and very little time to devote to the hobby, I’ve been around long enough to have my fair share of memorable video game moments.  

The soul crushing experience of beating Ghouls &amp; Ghosts only to find it demanding a second play through to officially beat the game...  Neighborhood friends leaning on my windowsill, mouth agape when we discovered the blood code for Mortal Kombat. My little brother and I picking our jaws up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minutes of Devil May Cry on our PS2 on Christmas morning having never experienced graphics like that on a console before. The two of us huddled under our covers absolutely terrified during a 2 AM session of resident evil or silent hill.

As I mentioned before, now that I’m a dad and don’t have nearly as much time to devote to playing video games as I would like. That said, as I look back, there are a few titles that I would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of consoles. 

**SSX Tricky**- The original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capabilities of that generation of consoles however SSX Tricky brought the beautiful graphics head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physics while adding its own unique brand of humor, customization, and addictive leveling system, all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combinations not seen since the days of Tony Hawk Pro skater. 

To see this title brought to the next generation of consoles with a graphical overhaul, and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new PS5 controllers. Imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo... there’s just so much potential hear it makes me a little crazy. 

**Oddworld: Strangers Wrath** - I can’t honestly remember how I stumbled across this game but it was one that I feel didn’t quite get the praise in attention it deserved. I could be wrong about this, perhaps that was just my perception, but I was left so satisfied after playing through this title. How seamlessly they were able to blend third person  3D platformer and first person shooter was just incredible. And the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volumes. The humor laced throughout, the creativity of “live ammunition“, and with a fantastic storyline to boot, this is one of those titles that genuinely left me sad upon completion as I just simply didn’t want it to end.

**Tiger Woods circa early-mid 2000s** - Damn was this title addictive. I know they are still pumping out titles but they are just not the same. No it wasn’t a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that’s what made it great. The injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation, incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanics, silly customizations, and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from David Feherdy &amp; Gary McCord made these titles so much damn fun. Nothing since has quite been able to capture the magic this series once had. They need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigans. Bring this series back to its glory days! Hell you didn’t even have to like golf to enjoy those games.

New studio acquisitions,"With Microsoft's 7.5 BILLION dollar purchase of Zenimax/Bethesda, I have seen a lot of articles and podcast talking about what studios Sony can buy in response. When I think about it, I would hope that if Sony has money stashed away for these type of acquisitions it would be better spent on creating new studios.
First off, a new studio would cost significantly less than buying established IP. Some of them are outlandish propositions people were putting out would have Sony buying Square Enix (valued around 6.8 billion) and even ubisoft (valued at 10.5 billion). Even if you consider a more realistic acquisition like From Soft(which is tied up under a much larger parent company) or Platinum, you are still talking about very expensive deals.
You could build new mid-sized (70 people) studios for approximately $25 - 35 million (salary + overhead) for the three to four years they would need to start self sustaining with revenue.
What if they started four of them!
They would come with the benefit of creating even more diversity that we would get to play.
I would be far less excited for them to buy an existing studio that already was planning on putting their games on PlayStation.

I think this is the first generation of new consoles where I'll have too much to play.",PS5,131,0.47
PS5 teardown,"What if playstation and Sony are waiting for AMD to reveal their GPU for them to do the teardown. It has been leaked that the new GPUs will be clocked similar to the ps5 gpu. Maybe the ""secret sauce"" teased is what AMD will reveal in their October showcase.",PS5,12,0.42

SSD Cartridges instead of Discs for consoles,"Wanted to know why PS did not go for SSD Cartridges for games instead of blu ray discs. It would have been easier as you can have each game with custom storage rather than being limited, Plus would be easier to use.

Custom controller profiles for each purchased game,"Not all games allow you to remap your controls and that could be frustrating. So, it would be nice to have a feature that’ll allow you to set up custom controller profiles for each game.

"Nippon Marathon 2 Is Apparently Getting a Kickstarter (29th on) (I'm unrelated, just a fan)","So while everyone is playing Fall Guys, I have been playing for the last year or so+, Nippon Marathon, it's honestly Fall Guys on crack (but came a lot earlier), being like this weird japanese game show but reality thing where there is a humanoid dog in a shirt and scarf battling an old japanese man in a school girl outfit, etc. I really liked it, and I had found out that there is going to be a kickstarter for this game on the 29th, and it's apparently getting physical (which implies console release, and they even kind of point out that in the info), and like, I'm so damn ready for this beautiful jank mess of a game to hopefully get a sequel.

Anyone else a fan of the first one? I for one am excited for a sequel, though I hope they don't try to jack of the graphics above their talents, and it hurts the game itself (like trine 3, rip)

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",PS5,1614,0.87

Disappointing UK/PAL Box Art News: PS5 to KEEP the PS4 plain white text spine art for Sony games,"When we got box art for Miles Morales in PAL territories, we saw that it had a logo on the side, something that almost never happens for Sony first party pal games... Apart from Spiderman. It led many of us to hope that this would carry over to all next gen first party titles. We had also theorised that perhaps it was just for Spiderman so it would look similar to the first game's, as it appeared to be replicating the box art too.

Unfortunately, that is not the case (pun not intended). The box art for Sackboy has been revealed, and it has the cursed plain white text on it's spine

If you are wondering the meaning of this, [I made a more detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/) about this back when we got that news, complete with pics for non-PAL readers

But I'll give you a brief summary

* If you buy a PAL First party sony game, you get a generic white/black text on the spine of the box. This alone wouldn't be a problem, as the PS2 in Europe had it, and it's quite aesthetically pleasing. The problem is that it is ONLY Sony games with this, instead of everyone like for the PS2. This leaves your collection on your shelf looking like a collection of games, and pirated movies you bought in a foreign country on your vacation.

I was personally holding out hope for some change this generation, but it looks like I am going o have to look into the custom covers/slipcover community to fix this unfortunate reality

This is especially disappointing, as Sony promised a more global approach this generation, but this notion seems to have been just PR speak.

FAQs

&gt;I like the plain text on the PS2!

As do I, but it needs to be all or nothing. All logos, or all plain, it makes some look like lazy knock offs if they're alone

&gt;Why do you care so much?

As a physical owner, I like being able to look on a shelf and seeing the game's I've sunk many hours into. 99.99% of the time, I will finish a game, and then it will sit on the shelf. Is it that wrong to care for how a display piece looks?

&gt;Just use the alternate cover!

I would... if we got those. Most PAL territories get health warnings on the inside cover instead of the reversible covers found on Spiderman and God of War

&gt;Just Print out the US one!

Also not an option, as Sony doesn't put these scans up for Piracy reasons, meaning that if you get one it's a user's own scan, which are far from a good quality. Or you have to import an empty case, which starts to stack up as a costly endeavour if you're replacing a dozen first party games

&gt;First World problem much?

You're right, but Gaming is a first world pastime. If I am spending as much as I am on a game, it's not unreasonable to have packaging that looks good.

&gt;OCD?

No, just have a shelf, like that shelf, want to have some consistency in the games on that shelf",PS5,9,0.44

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",PS5,276,0.82
What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",PS5,158,0.85
Sony should make PS5 UI like their phone UI. Customizable home screen and app drawer.,"PS4's current UI is a disaster, especially if you have a lot of games.  They should adopt a ui similar to phones, with customizable home screen, an easily accessible app drawer, and a home and multitasking button.  The current UI tries to reinvent the wheel and makes things overly complicated.",PS5,10,0.26
What Is do you think biggest advancement from ps4 to ps5 out of all of these?,"We got ray tracing 

We got a Much better cpu 

We got a ssd 

Dual sense (controllers) 

Better graphics (1.8 ps4, ps5 10) 

Better memory usage

3D audio (tempest)

Cooling (it is said the ps5 will be a lot quieter) 


So which of them do you think is the biggest or most exciting advancement? If I missed  something please tell me.",PS5,32,0.47

What little things (like the UI) are you hoping for?,For me I really want Sony to integrate a better app. It should be wayyy easier to automatically send pictures/clips to your phone.,PS5,99,0.87

There’s really not a lot out there at this moment that’s peaked my interest, leaning towards Destiny but just not sure.",PS5,101,0.62
I want to see people open up their PS5,"I'm curious to see the internal differences between the digital and the disc versions. I opened up my PS4 last week and the disc unit is massive and now I'm wondering what implications/benefits its absence could bring to a console. Smaller, more efficient or quieter fan, smaller power unit, ease to clean up is what I can think of without much effort. They could even leave a spot to add a second SSD, which is very unlikely, but it would be awesome.",PS5,54,0.7

How can VRR be useful for PS5 users?,"Considering you won't really get to go north of 30/60fps for most games, I don't quite see how VRR will make a difference in console gaming. I'm far from being an expert but fps should be pretty stable from what I understand. Am I missing something here?",PS5,14,0.29
"As we're all waiting for GoW Ragnarok, watch ""Raising Kratos"" if you've missed out so far",,PS5,40,0.9
Who else wishes for Sony to have diverse genre of games instead of just story driven third person games?,"As great the story driven games of PS4 are, I wish there were more variety in first party lineup. The games are getting more samey and I am sure I'd eventually get bored of them just like I got bored of Assassins Creed Series and Gears series.

There are no first party multiplayer heavy FPS game, similar to Halo. 

No RPG like BOTW. The only good open world first person RPG Elder Scrolls is supposedly not coming to PS5 and Avowed is the only game that seems to be falling under the same category, which is also again not coming to PS5.

There are no first party arcade racers or cart racers like Forza Horizon or Mario Kart.

 There are no 2D platforming like Ori or Donkey Kong. 

No turn based strategy game like Mario Rabbid or Gears Tactics. 

No game to play and chill with friends, similar to Animals Crossing or Sea Of Thieves.

 No fighting game like Smash Bros or Killer Instinct.

 No RTS like Halo Wars or AoE.

Basically, they were asking me my thoughts on VR, if I owned a PSVR, if I still play it, and why/why not.

They also asked 'What is the most important: gaming on a dedicated device, or being able to play games across multiple devices.'

Very interesting. Could Sony be thinking about opening game streaming to phones like Microsoft is doing? Or perhaps the next PSVR will be open and let you use it with other devices (phones, computers, tablets, etc)?

"Sony's PS5 ""Gamer Feel"" + Wipeout 4, Motorstorm, Knack 3, The Order?","**From** PS1 to PS4, Sony have been there for us as gamers. From the feel-good moments  (""$299!"") &amp; the success taking on the Nintendo 64 &amp; Sega Saturn Juggernauts, Sony started strong.

By the time the PS3 had really hit its stride, with fantastic first party studio acquisitions and partnerships like Naughty Dog, From Software, and Media Molecule, I've always felt that despite owning multiple consoles &amp; PCs, Sony earnt my loyalty.

There have been some tough moments on PS4 (lacking wishlists, playtime, easy internal media storage, and no backwards compatibility through emulation of our PS1/PS2 collections, among others) but we've always been able to count on Sony to treat us like gamers and not insult the value of our time, bringing us first-party experiences like no other, and sharing it with PC &amp; other console brethren when possible. **So thank you Sony**, for bringing up welling excitement with the PS5 like never  before.

**To the point of this post**. There are a few franchises which are difficult to imagine life without, however it feels like too long already. Sony, can you bring us these, in some form or another? Or will they forever languish, lost to competing interests or past memories?

\-**Wipeout Series**. On all Sony consoles, there has been that reliable ultra-fast anti-grav racing experience. The thrill of modern hard electronica thudding through our brains, whilst the blood heats in our veins, has been a fantastic thing to enjoy since the one I began with, Wipeout 2097 (XL for NTSC partiers). It furthered a lifelong love of sensory overload and thumping breaks/d&amp;b. Will it come to PS5? Every month without an announcement is torturous, and surely others feel the same.

\-**Motorstorm Series**. More metal &amp; grunge than anything, and channelling Road Rash, Twisted Metal, and Carmageddon all at the same time, again with the aural overload that brings home the bass. As an Aussie, the locales often dug deep into that need to explore the unknown, and one misses it every day since a very first 720p game on the Fat PS3.

\-**Knack 3**. As someone who likes to look nothing up about games before immersing myself in the world, and after finishing the first knack with a partner, and finally getting around to the second most recently, it was very surprising to learn that the first was moderately well-received, and the second just so slightly more. No other game series, as someone who grew up in the '90s, has been able to put such a feeling of wondrous youth and excitement as an adult. 

**Knack 1 &amp; 2 were** **that** **feeling** of waking up at 5 am, sneaking into the TV room with a blanket, and watching Saturday morning cartoons - but this time, as an adult, with a significant other! That feeling is priceless, in a world where many have lost their ""wonder &amp; magic"" feelings to the prey of a quick, endlessly unsatisfying slot machine-type loop. 

\-**The Order: 1886**. This was a wonderfully cerebral take on the most detailed steampunk city that I've witnessed. The story was gripping, the combat was thrilling, and of course, there was no sequel or mention, after the mediocre reviews ripped it apart for being ""boring, unambitious, not next-gen, a glorified walking simulator"". I am sad to think that this franchise isn't given wings (or perhaps the figurative wings it has been given are the wrong ones?).

\-**PT.** Please. Make it so. The masses have spoken.

So, In conclusion to this essay-length feature, for anyone that made it this far, is a request to SIE to keep valuing our intelligence, and especially those of us that don't have the money but spend it anyway, because we continue to trust in your expertise as gamers and successful innovators.

Don't take the easy monetization route, or one that compromises your ability to reach us Single-player experience-based gamers, because in this day and age, when some of us desperately need another world to be transported away to, we don't want to worry whether that world will be there for us in the future.

What kind of game is missing from Sony’s first party lineup of games?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the games Sony has in the oven ready to go over the next few years. They have a really wide variety of incredibly successful franchises and I don’t think there’s a lot of worry about whether the PS5 will struggle to find enough titles that by themselves will sell consoles. But where’s their weakness? What genre is leaving the biggest hole in Sony Studios first party lineup?

There are a few areas I think Sony could stand to invest in. First, is a military shooter. Maybe not first person, but something heavily combat focused with multiplayer potential. I’m sure the Crist thought goes right to SOCOM, as it should. People have been asking for a reboot for a while now and it’s for good reason. SOCOM was a tight, tactical shooter that gave many players their first taste of online multiplayer. It would do well with a reboot and could solidify the PS5 as the complete console package. 

The second area Sony should look into is a bit ambitious. But a 100+ hour open world game like The Witcher or Red Dead or even Assassin’s Creed would be something gamers could find themselves buying a console just to play. What I mean by this is a huge open world game that keeps players invested in the world and experiences long after the main story is complete. Sony has explored open world style games with Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and most recently with Ghost of Tushima. This has extra implication because Xbox has the Bethesda, the undisputed king of making open world epics. 

Finally, Sony needs a sci-fi game. I don’t really know where on the spectrum of sci-s game needs to fall but with Killzone on the shelf collecting dust something needs to take its place. An argument could be made that Horizon meets the sci-fi criteria but I’m looking more in the realm of aliens, space ships, and energy weapons. It’s a hard genre to perfect but when you do it right it has lasting potential in the world of gaming. I think Sony could see this lasting potential turn into a large adoption of consoles.",PS5,65,0.57

I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?,"So if you all recall, the PS3 and especially PS4 user interfaces were lacking in a lot of features upon the launch of the respective consoles. For example, both consoles got **themes and background customization support** a lot further down the road. (I always found it weird that even though themes were very much a  thing on PS3, they weren't a thing on PS4 at all until I think about a year into the console's life.

PS4, specifically, got the following features and some others that I'm probably forgetting about a number of years after the console launched: **(folders, quick menu support, online/offline appearance, etc.)**

Sony knows that all these features and more are the kinds of things we expect from the start of a generation at this point. Since they're basically ""quid pro quo"" features for any good UI nowadays. But going off of their track record, I am just concerned we'll be missing a lot of these cool features come November 12th. Keep in mind, I have no idea of the complexities of UI development and don't want to undermine the hard work I'm sure they're putting into the UI.

That reasoning is pushing me to lean towards the ps4 pro since its a little bit smaller. Just curious to other peoples thoughts on that.

"I don't like the idea of Sony buying, konami, capcom or square enix, or any other big publisher.","I have a few  opinions that i want to talk about, hope this post doesn't get deleted

I think nurturing studios is the good way, the way sony did so far,  what microsoft did is just throw money at zenimax and that's it. Is funny how Microsoft hasn't even talked about games that much, all of their doing so far is litetally just throwing money with cheap gamepass service and buying a big publisher.

What i want to say with this is, Sony so far has shown more games (let the games do the talking) and a lot of users seems to forget that the most important part of a service or games  is to have good things to go for, i know gamepass has good games but honestly i don't think all worth paying a monthly fee, a lot are praising gamepass, praising microsoft buying zenimax, which in my mind is bad for all of us, on top of this, MS still hasn't showed or proved that their are going to have a good line up so far.
I know you may say ""but they bought several good team developers by buying zenimax"" well that's true, but we still have not seen any in regards of this, no games, no nada yet.

I think Sony still have a very solid games lineup, strong enough to convince anyone to have a ps5, just don't forget that games are what important most of anything else in this business.

Edit:

some more thoughts

I think MS is not competing, they want to take over the market with brute force (aka money)

Something that im questioning my self too

What would avoid MS to buy a lot more third party publishers, like take two or ea, or ubisoft, in lets say 5-7 years?
It will not be fair to us users having MS locking all of the third party gaming publishers for the sake of ""being competitive""

If i had money to spare i would be beting that this is how microsoft is going to compete from now on until they get most of the share of the market and then to fully become a monopoly, if they succeed.

A Case for Remakes.,"I don't know if I am in the minority here, but I am loving this new boom of video game remakes. Sure, it can be seen as lazy to just give an old game a new can of paint and sell it off to us for nostalgia reasons, but I'm actually excited about that.

As a movie buff, I am always interested in remakes, seeing how a different director puts his vision into a known project. I guess the same thing pertains to games. I want to see how my old favorites would look with modern graphics. Plus, with recent remakes, they feel like entirely new games (FF7 remake), despite being the same subject material.

So, are there any old games you'd love to see remade? I'd love to see Dead Space make a return. Although looking at it now, the lighting is ahead of its time by a mile, it would be nice to see it with crazy graphics. And the 3D sound? Mah Gahd. Also, next gen damage models for the nechromorphs would look beautiful. And maybe F.E.A.R.? Maybe I just want a resurgence in action horror.",PS5,67,0.67

Unanswered questions regarding the Playstation 5,"I apologize for my bad english.   
This  is not about anwering my ""questions"" but more about the fact that many things are still unknown. All these things can change the opinion on the Playstation 5 drastically. 

The PS5 release date and price are finally public (or atleast for more than a week). Some people were lucky enough and managed to pre-order a Playstation 5 and many people were not. I was lucky enough and managed to grab a launch day PS5 Disk Preorder. Since that day I've been unpatiently counting down the days 'till I can get my hands on that beautiful piece of tech.

And yet there are some questions that are floating in my mind.

**What is the noise level of the Playstation 5?**The Playstation 4 was known for its bad cooling system and loud fans and I'm worried that the PS5 will be the continuation of this story. Sony already announced that they invested a huge amount of money into the development of a good cooling solution but there is always a fine line between marketing babble and facts. I for my part did not own a PS4 (I switched to PC) and can't judge it for myself but I'm still worried.

**Why is sony still so vague about backwards compability?**I know, I know... Sony already announced that many games PS4 games will be playable on the PS5 but I'm still wondering how PS5 digital users will be able to do so. Sony is still really vague and I'm worried that there will be on or another catch. Microsoft really did a good job and made everything quite clear.I'm still hoping that sony will do the same. I really can't wait on getting my hands on all those great PS4 games that I missed out on. (Yes. I will definitely make use of the PS plus collection)

**What will the UI look like?**Up until now we were only able to get a short glimpse at the new Playstation 5 UI. I'm really looking forward on getting more footage of the UI.

**What's with Background Applications like Discord, or Teamspeak?**It wasn't possible with the Playstation 4 but maybe with the 5. I really would like to be able to talk to my PC or Xbox friends while I'm playing on my PS5 without leaving my computer on. This feature would really improve the whole gaming experience.

**Will we ever get a black PS5 oder atleast good Playstation 5 skins?**The opinions on the Playstation 5 design vary quite a lot and range from ""I love it"" to ""It's fcking disgusting"". The design of consoles or rather more everything is always a highly subjective matter but still... Sony made a high risk choice. The Playstation 5 design really stands out and some or not many people would appreciate the ability to get  rid  of the white colour. I am really hoping for a black PS5.Thankfully Dbrand already announced their skin line-up for the Playstation 5.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these questions above won't change the fact that we all will have a lot of fun the Playstation 5. All  of these announced Playstation 5 games sound highly promising and I can't wait to play them all. (RIP wallet)",PS5,41,0.45

Will disk-based PS5 games require a full-copy/install to play?,"Update: This is 100% the case. I didn't realize PS4 already does this so fully expect this to continue. 

Has Sony talked about how they plan to handle disk-based games and game installs? This new PS5 SSD technology doesn't really apply if the system has to try to read the data from the disk, which I'd guess is many factors slower than SSD read speeds. I imagine it wouldn't need to copy over certain things, like menus and other data that doesn't need to be read as quickly. But those make up a small portion of the actual game data.

What I could totally see them doing is: You pop the disk in, and it has to copy over nearly the entire game over to the SSD for gameplay. I REALLY hope this isn't the case. The reason I bought the disk-based console is to mitigate the issue that my HD is constantly full from downloading games/updates. If the console requires copying over disk-based games, that benefit goes out the window. I would still get the benefit that copying from disk is still faster than download speeds if I want to delete and later reinstall the game.

I know that specs don't matter but PS5 is way closer than people think to the Series X on every level,"1. The CPU conundrum and why many seem to misunderstand it. While *fixed clocked speeds seem inherently better than variable frequencies, they are much harder to cool since the system needs to be ready for a worse case scenario at all times and use up more power needlessly.* There's a reason why every major semiconductor has ditched fixed clock speeds for more than 5 years and it's the reason the PS4 seemed loud as heck (lack of culling) [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/fujtke/purpose_of_variable_frequencies/) thread sums the this point better if interested but that's the basic idea why PS5 went for Smartshift vs going for a fixed frequency.
2. GPU: Same point about the variable clock speeds vs fixed. The biggest difference to me here is the amount of CU's the Series X has for RT performance vs  the PS5 not the Tflops.  80 bil ray/s x 208 RT cores (52 x 4 TMU's per CU's in RDNA2 and each TMU has 1 RT Core in RDNA2) x 1825 mhz divided by the industry standard 10 deep BVH and the result is roughly 38 Giga rays/s , so it will have way better performance on that front. Now the PS5 GPU has more fill rate, internal GPU bandwidth and faster triangle set-up so it's not a knockout just because Youtubers tell u 12 vs 10,2 Tflops.
3. Ram: The biggest problem for the Series X imo. While it's 10 GB's of Vram are **insanely fast** (can't stress that enough) it's simply not enough for some games at 4K, we're seeing that now with the 3080 and just how much lack of Vram can hurt. Problem number 2 is that it's segmented unlike the PS5's unified 16 GB running at 448 GB/s. The Series X also uses half a gig of ram more than the PS5 for the OS but that's nothing crazy.
4. SSD: Short and sweet since this isn't much of a battle. The Series X in theory can do a maximum of 6GB/s compressed which thanks to bottle necks is closer to 3GB/S real life performance. PS5 can go to up to 22 GB/S thanks to the IO coprocessors, crazy SSD and Kraken Decompression unit meaning in real performance that games can load in about 2 -3 seconds flat.

Conclusion: The PS5 was designed to be as easy to develop for as humanely possible (which was clear after the Road to PS5) since it doesn't have any major bottlenecks as a system and while not offering the same beefy performance as the Series X it does make it's power easier to access to devs so I don't think anyone should expect major if any differences on 3rd party multiplats.

Backwards comparability work around,"I read today that if you own the Standard PS5 you’ll be able to insert your PS4 disks and they’ll convert to a digital version that will then be playable on your PS5.

What would stop me from purchasing a Standard PS5, converting the few PS4 disks I have to their digital versions using the disk drive, and then retuning the Standard PS5 to the store.

Idea for a new Castlevania game,"This is my own personal opinion on how to make a new one and how to do it right. To be clear, this is a 3D Castlevania game.

- Dark Souls/Bloodborne inspired with a focus on the checkpoint to checkpoint style gameplay
- Game is meant to be difficult but fair *(just like Dark Souls and the Classic Castlevania games)*
- Classic enemies from the old games to come back with their iconic designs but just modernized a bit
- Soundtrack meant to invoke memories of playing the NES and SNES Castlevania games
- Whip is used to attack as well as grab items or even get to areas out of reach of a normal jump
- Bring back the wall meat behind secret breakable walls!
- Classic items like the cross, the throwing axe and holy water to return and with some new functionality to make them useful in a 3D environment 
- Base game features a full and complete story of the main character, Simon Belmont, defeating Dracula
- Each DLC is it’s own story with new locations, enemies, and you play as a new character with unique weapons and items",PS5,24,0.39
Could we see the return of couch co-op with next gen?,"The last two generations it was difficult for consoles to run games with two camera views at a solid FPS and decent resolution. Most Devs priorities lied in just getting the best they could with one camera.

Sony can and should offer PS5 enhanced versions of PS4 games for free like microsoft.,"Microsoft lets you buy a copy of grand theft auto 4 13 years ago and still support it on their next generation hardware. Sony can't even make a enhanced version of spiderman ps4 free to current owners.

I'm just wondering what others in this community think about this.


Edit: ok so GTA IV was a bad example (but a fantastic game, pls be on ps5), basically my point was that CDPR, ubisoft, microsoft and a few others have said that the next generation version, as in the entire updated/enhanced game will be available to current owners for free.
These games are going to be a goodwill to consumers who are early adopters to new platforms and will hopefully be available years into the generation.

Sony is ""remastering"" a 2 year old game rather than providing a substantial update, this is a ploy to get people to buy it twice, they are clearly not trying to bolster sales to people who do not own it because it's only available as a collectors edition on top of the sequel.

Expanding Your PS5 Drive Space? Note That NVMe Drives Must Be Whitelisted by Sony,"I’m seeing a lot of chatter after Microsoft released their SSD expansion drive ($220!!!!). That’s honestly a lot of money. However, I’m seeing a lot of response from people saying that thank goodness PS5 will take any NVMe drive which can have prices anywhere from $50 to hundreds of dollars depending on size. 

However, you need to note that Sony must [whitelist the SSD drive](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5)

You can’t use any NVMe drive, so please don’t buy a cheap one you found online thinking it’ll work. I don’t believe anything has been officially whitelisted by Sony yet. There’s one drive that people are assuming might work, which is [this one](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price).

Note that it’s $229 for 1TB. The cost of super fast load times and world loading is expensive. At least for now. *So I just wanted to warn people and inform people to just wait for a bit until we get official confirmation from Sony on which drives will work. And brace yourself on price. Maybe they’ll be $229, maybe they’ll be less, but they definitely won’t be cheap. Don’t buy a NVMe drive until we get confirmation that it’ll work in the system.*

Edit: There’s some discussion of semantics on what “whitelisting” means in this article. It’s beside the point. Sony and Mark Cerny have already stated they will provide a list of compatible drives. If the system may allow drives that Sony doesn’t recommend but still technically work, that’s up to individuals to try. For the vast majority of you, focus on the italicized text above and do not buy anything until Sony provides a list of compatible drives. The system doesn’t take just any NVMe drive and buying some random cheap one off Amazon will not work.",PS5,479,0.95

Schreier is a well-connected insider who has broken countless industry stories, so his information carries a bit more weight to me than most ""insider"" knowledge.

I think it's understandable that a lot of people have made ""see you in 2025"" jokes after what happened with FFXV and FFVII Remake. However, it's important to remember that the team behind FFXVI is a completely different team from those games. They share none of the same leaders, and the team behind FFXVI is known for its efficiency (primarily due to their work on the MMO, FFXIV). But this is the first time we've gotten specific info about how long the game has been in development, and I think it's longer than most people realized. Just figured this was worthwhile info for people to have.",PS5,685,0.97

How to improve PS Now?,"While PS Now has more than enough titles to be played, the majority of games have to be streamed. Only certain PS4 and surprisingly PS2 titles can be downloaded. There is no way to emulate PS3 games. Streaming games requires a very strong internet connection, preferably a wired connection or 5ghz wireless. However, the quality of streamed games via PS Now isn't up to the quality compared to other cloud based services (e.g. GeForce Now). How could Sony make the service much more appealing to costumers? Here are some points that i think would greatly enhance the service:

1. **Make PS Now a software based full backwards compatibility solution:**

\- Bring back the game catalog of PS1 classics and expand the games we have on PS Now

\- Make it possible to emulate PS3 games  (maybe the PS5 could do it?) OR improve the streaming quality;

\- PSNow should be the ""game pass"" of older Playstation games

**2. Tie in the Playstation Store**

\- The PS4 can emulate PS2 games; why didnt we get the PS2 games we bought digitally back in the store? -&gt; apply this to PS1 games aswell

\- Games available on PSNow should be able to be bought through the PS Store (apply this for PS4 and PS5 users)

**3. PS Plus**

\- PSNow should be included in PS Plus OR in a PS Plus Premium subscription

\- Give away one month of PSNow (or PS Plus) whenever someone buys accessoires for their consoles (like controllers)

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to see PS Now as a software solution to the missing full backwards compatibility we have on the PS5. Bring back PS1 and PS2 games into the PS Store, because there really is no reason to keep those games away from the store, when we can already see that the PS4 console can emulate PS2 games through PSNow. Also, if it can emulate PS2 games, it should also be able to emulate PS1 games easily. I admit PS3 games are tricky, and if the PS5 is not able to emulate PS3 games, then Sony should improve their cloud based gaming.

**TL;DR:** Bring back PS1/PS2 games to the store, add those games into PSNow, improve cloud based gaming for PS3 games, include the service in PS Plus or in a new ""Premium"" PS Plus subscription",PS5,79,0.74

Serious question: is there any reason behind why in EU we should pay the equivalent of $95 or is it just a scam?,"As per above, first party Sony games in EU cost the equivalent of $95 (€80), while in the US they cost ""just"" $70 (equivalent of about €60). Is there any weird conversion thing going on or is it just an additional fee for Europe stacked with the additional fee Sony gave their games?

As far as I know Euro has more value, so it should be the other way around if anything. It's very strange.",PS5,292,0.81

Appreciation of future proofing,"With 49 days left to go I wanted to draw some attention to some of the benefits of an upgrade that aren’t necessarily game related. The quality of life stuff that as a launch PS4 owner are the biggest reasons I’m super amped for the next generation. Those being the NVME expandable storage, WiFi 6, and HDMI 2.1. All of those are yet to be ubiquitous, and while we may have a slightly weaker console it’s amazing that they packed years worth of upgrades in for the same cost as a competitor. 

WiFi 6 is still potentially limited for some things on PlayStation’s end, but with game streaming and digital downloads becoming more and more prevalent and gigabit internet becoming more common it’s awesome that we may see much higher throughput. 

NVME upgradeable internal storage is a HUGE win. Not being locked to a certain size or company could benefit us immensely in terms of cost in the long run. 

HDMI 2.1 is already here, though not super affordable yet. While I don’t see these consoles ever hitting 8K with some insane DLSS style magic 4K 120 already feels like a great late gen target for especially first party titles. 

Let me know if I’m out of line or missed something!

TLDR; I’m really excited for the quality of life stuff on PS5, a couple that aren’t even available with competitors. Next gen is all about convenience and I’m here for it.",PS5,113,0.64

For all those worried that £70 will become the standard game price,"Game prices are typically inflated at launch due to a captive market.  This link, thanks to u/xenorvernix shows that most launch titles were priced at £55.

After launch prices for new titles dropped to around £40 (rising to £45-50 in 2018 due to the falling value of the pound)

I agree that the £10 increase worldwide is likely due to catching up with inflation, but I think the pricing on top of that is simply the higher prices that launch titles typically sell for. I'd expect games to average around £55-60 in the future",PS5,145,0.53

I really don't like the location of Spider-Man: Miles Morales. so listen to me rant about it,"Not going to lie, kind of got mad when I heard in the trailer, ""This is the best part of living in Harlem."" Yea I know Harlem is cool and I know that's where he lives in the Spider-Man for PS4 game, but the map is going to be an exact copy of the PS4 map. Unless you can go farther north of Manhattan I don't really want to just play a copy of Spider-Man for PS4 if the only difference is the story and characters.

In my humble opinion I think it should've taken place is Brooklyn, and here's why

1. Miles lives in Brooklyn. In the original comics, most tv show's he's been referenced in. Heck, even Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
2. Brooklyn is a completely different map. New places to explore and people can get over playing in Manhattan and move onto Brooklyn. I think it's idiotic that they just copy and pasted the exact same thing. At least move the location
3. Brooklyn is so much better than Manhattan. First, it's skyline is still pretty large and if that's the only reason it's still in Manhattan is because it's skyline is slightly smaller that's like saying L.A. is better because the hills are bigger than San Diego. Second, People who aren't familiar with Brooklyn can get to know at least the basics. I had no idea where things were in Manhattan but Spider-Man for PS4 taught me that. I think we're all ready to move on to Manhattan's younger but cooler sister. And Third, Manhattan is boring to at least me... I can't tell you how many times I've played PS4 Spider-Man but then just got bored of Manhattan. I wished I could go to Brooklyn or even at least to liberty island but no. Just same old Manhattan
4. And finally, Why not? It's not like there's gonna be any problems. One, If it's because Brooklyn is too big, then just cut a few things out. Not all of Brooklyn has to be there. And if it's because Brooklyn has some parts that are mostly residential and filled with one story/two story houses... well
5. Why they shouldn't... There are a ton of parts in Brooklyn where it's just mostly residential houses and not apartments or tall skyscrapers. But of course there are in Manhattan too. Not as much of course but still. I think that is one of the main reasons why they won't stage it in Brooklyn, but I still think Brooklyn would be a lovely place for a Spider-Man to take place in. So get on that

EDIT:

So I've gotten the feedback I wanted and turns out the game wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. People have told me it's more of an expansion pack than a new game in of itself. And it seems some people do agree with me. But in the wrong context

People agree that when actual Spider-Man 2 comes out, then yes it would be amazing to be able to go to Brooklyn and or... Jersey City? Anyway people really didn't agree with me ranting about this game. The game I was ranting about was a game that was just more of an expansion pack than a new game. And yea I didn't know that and yea I probably should've researched it before making a 5-6 paragraph post ranting about it.

In conclusion. I still think that going to Brooklyn in actual Spider-Man 2 would be awesome. But for now I understand why they wouldn't for this game. ",PS5,29,0.24

I understand that the dying a lot is a part of souls games and im fine with that. The big part about me not continuing with bloodborne, is just that I literally had no idea where to go lol. The combat alone couldn’t keep me into the game as I felt like I wasn’t progressing. I just want to know if demon souls has that same type of just leaving you in the world aspect of bloodborne, or if they kinda show you where to go and help guide you in a way, like a linear experience (The gameplay trailer looked like it guided you to the boss) I’m not asking for it to hold my hand the entire way though, I just want to play the game without having to search the internet or use YouTube videos all the time like how people recommend to do with bloodborne.

Are These M Rated Games Appropriate For A 13 Year Old?,"A bit of back round knowledge I am a 13 year old who is a soon to be first time play PlayStation owner.

Like many of you I am really excited for the PlayStation 5. I was one of the lucky few who was able to preorder the PlayStation 5. I plan to use the PlayStation 5 for backwards compatibility for the first one to two years. I already have the Uncharted games, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ratchet and Clank. My problem is that there are four M rated games I want to play, these are God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. I cant play these games legally unless my parents buy the games for me. So what makes these games M rated? My parents would be ok with stuff like bad words and a bit of blood but things like really gory stuff or other stuff I don't know about. So If you can leave a reply about stuff that happens in these games that would be nice and if you need to know more i'll try to answer people.

TL;DR Im 13 and want these M rated games God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. What makes them M rated?

UPDATE

I looked at what many people have said. I think I am going to get Persona 5 and God of War. People said the other to games were a bit much, I will wait to get those games till I am older. People said god of war is a lot of fantasy violence and bad words which is ok. I still kinda think about if my parents will let me play Persona 5 but, Many of you said I had Important themes that could show me good morales. I'll probably ask for these games in Christmas season and thats when my parents will look into this stuff. So thanks for helping me with the good advice!",PS5,370,0.79
